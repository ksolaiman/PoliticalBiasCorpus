They included Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch known as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “chef.”</p> <p>The poisoning of the former Russian double agent and his daughter is the first chemical weapons attack in Europe since World War II, the U.S. and its allies said, accusing Moscow of violating international laws. The Kremlin has denied any role in the attack and vowed to retaliate after British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats, the biggest such move by the government since the end of the Cold War.</p> <p>But President Trump, acting on sanctioning powers granted by Congress months ago, was more muted in his criticism of the regime in Moscow and again avoided rebuking Mr. Putin personally.</p> <p>Asked if Mr. Putin was behind the nerve gas attack on Russian defector Sergei Skripal, Mr. Trump replied, “It looks like it.”</p> <p>“A very sad situation — it certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,” Mr. Trump told reporters during an Oval Office event with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in advance of St. Patrick’s Day. “Something that should never, ever happen. We’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.”</p> <p>Mr. Trump didn’t mention the sanctions or Russian meddling in the election, an issue that has been a sore point for the president since Democrats used it to try to question the legitimacy of his White House win. The president’s continued reluctance to call out Mr. Putin has raised eyebrows among Mr. Trump’s political foes and allies in Washington.</p> <p>British officials have been far more blunt in criticizing Russia, even as the U.S., France and Germany signed on to a letter saying there was “no plausible alternative explanation” to the nerve gas attack and calling it an assault on British sovereignty.</p> <p>The Russian government “should go away and shut up,” British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson told reporters.</p> <p>Targeting the energy grid</p> <p>The Russians hit with U.S. sanctions were involved in election meddling and cyberattacks, including what Treasury Department and national security officials said were attacks on the U.S. energy grid, aviation system and infrastructure. It was the first time the administration fingered Russia for cyberattacks that began at least two years ago.</p> <p>Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said the sanctions were part of a “broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.”</p> <p>“The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyber activity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyber-attacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,” he said in a statement.</p> <p>Moscow vowed to retaliate.</p> <p>“We have already started working on our reciprocal measures,” said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov. He didn’t elaborate on what response to expect.</p> <p>Moscow has denied involvement in the poisoning, and Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied — including directly to Mr. Trump last year — that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.</p> <p>The sanctions target the Russian spy agency FSB and Russia’s military intelligence agency GRU, as well as the Internet Research Agency, which Mr. Mueller has signaled was behind much of the cybermeddling in the presidential election.</p> <p>Treasury officials blamed the GRU and the Russian military for trying to interfere in the U.S. vote and for launching the “NotPetya” ransomware attack that wreaked havoc last year across the U.S., Europe and Asia.</p> <p>House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Edward R. Royce applauded the sanctions and said more needs to be done.</p> <p>“Russian cyberactors have been weaponizing information and targeting critical U.S. infrastructure undeterred for years,” said the California Republican. “As our midterm elections approach, we must send a clear message that attacks on our political process will not be tolerated.”</p> <p>Democrats slammed the sanctions for being too little, too late.</p> <p>“OK, it took 14 months, multiple indictments, and a poisoning in Britain … but … finally. Now we must protect our elections going forward,” tweeted Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat.</p> <p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a driving force in accusations of Trump campaign collusion with Russia, called the sanctions a “grievous disappointment.”</p> <p>He noted that only two more senior Russian officials were included and that the Obama administration had imposed sanctions in December 2016 on the others. He said it showed no new work by the Trump administration.</p> <p>“It appears that Mr. Mueller is doing more to place consequences on Russia’s behavior than the rest of the administration,” said Mr. Schiff.</p> <p>Friend or foe</p> <p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to clarify for reporters Thursday whether the White House considered Mr. Putin’s government a friend or an enemy.</p> <p>“Russia is going to have to make that determination,” she said. “They’re going to have to decide whether they want to be a good actor or a bad actor.”</p> <p>The Trump administration has punished Russia, including with sanctions, in response to its incursion into Ukraine and the forced closure of Russian outposts in San Francisco, New York and Washington.</p> <p>Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said that adding sanctions against the indicted Russians proved that Mr. Mueller’s investigation wasn’t a “witch hunt,” as the president claimed.</p> <p>“It’s more clear than ever that the president must not interfere with the special counsel’s investigation in any way,” Mr. Schumer said.</p> <p>The strained relations between the West and Russia reached a breaking point with the March 4 assassination attempt, which left the former spy, his daughter and a British police officer hospitalized with serious medical problems.

They included Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch known as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “chef.”</p> <p>The poisoning of the former Russian double agent and his daughter is the first chemical weapons attack in Europe since World War II, the U.S. and its allies said, accusing Moscow of violating international laws. The Kremlin has denied any role in the attack and vowed to retaliate after British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats, the biggest such move by the government since the end of the Cold War.</p> <p>But President Trump, acting on sanctioning powers granted by Congress months ago, was more muted in his criticism of the regime in Moscow and again avoided rebuking Mr. Putin personally.</p> <p>Asked if Mr. Putin was behind the nerve gas attack on Russian defector Sergei Skripal, Mr. Trump replied, “It looks like it.”</p> <p>“A very sad situation — it certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,” Mr. Trump told reporters during an Oval Office event with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in advance of St. Patrick’s Day. “Something that should never, ever happen. We’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.”</p> <p>Mr. Trump didn’t mention the sanctions or Russian meddling in the election, an issue that has been a sore point for the president since Democrats used it to try to question the legitimacy of his White House win. The president’s continued reluctance to call out Mr. Putin has raised eyebrows among Mr. Trump’s political foes and allies in Washington.</p> <p>British officials have been far more blunt in criticizing Russia, even as the U.S., France and Germany signed on to a letter saying there was “no plausible alternative explanation” to the nerve gas attack and calling it an assault on British sovereignty.</p> <p>The Russian government “should go away and shut up,” British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson told reporters.</p> <p>Targeting the energy grid</p> <p>The Russians hit with U.S. sanctions were involved in election meddling and cyberattacks, including what Treasury Department and national security officials said were attacks on the U.S. energy grid, aviation system and infrastructure. It was the first time the administration fingered Russia for cyberattacks that began at least two years ago.</p> <p>Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said the sanctions were part of a “broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.”</p> <p>“The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyber activity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyber-attacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,” he said in a statement.</p> <p>Moscow vowed to retaliate.</p> <p>“We have already started working on our reciprocal measures,” said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov. He didn’t elaborate on what response to expect.</p> <p>Moscow has denied involvement in the poisoning, and Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied — including directly to Mr. Trump last year — that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.</p> <p>The sanctions target the Russian spy agency FSB and Russia’s military intelligence agency GRU, as well as the Internet Research Agency, which Mr. Mueller has signaled was behind much of the cybermeddling in the presidential election.</p> <p>Treasury officials blamed the GRU and the Russian military for trying to interfere in the U.S. vote and for launching the “NotPetya” ransomware attack that wreaked havoc last year across the U.S., Europe and Asia.</p> <p>House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Edward R. Royce applauded the sanctions and said more needs to be done.</p> <p>“Russian cyberactors have been weaponizing information and targeting critical U.S. infrastructure undeterred for years,” said the California Republican. “As our midterm elections approach, we must send a clear message that attacks on our political process will not be tolerated.”</p> <p>Democrats slammed the sanctions for being too little, too late.</p> <p>“OK, it took 14 months, multiple indictments, and a poisoning in Britain … but … finally. Now we must protect our elections going forward,” tweeted Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat.</p> <p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a driving force in accusations of Trump campaign collusion with Russia, called the sanctions a “grievous disappointment.”</p> <p>He noted that only two more senior Russian officials were included and that the Obama administration had imposed sanctions in December 2016 on the others. He said it showed no new work by the Trump administration.</p> <p>“It appears that Mr. Mueller is doing more to place consequences on Russia’s behavior than the rest of the administration,” said Mr. Schiff.</p> <p>Friend or foe</p> <p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to clarify for reporters Thursday whether the White House considered Mr. Putin’s government a friend or an enemy.</p> <p>“Russia is going to have to make that determination,” she said. “They’re going to have to decide whether they want to be a good actor or a bad actor.”</p> <p>The Trump administration has punished Russia, including with sanctions, in response to its incursion into Ukraine and the forced closure of Russian outposts in San Francisco, New York and Washington.</p> <p>Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said that adding sanctions against the indicted Russians proved that Mr. Mueller’s investigation wasn’t a “witch hunt,” as the president claimed.</p> <p>“It’s more clear than ever that the president must not interfere with the special counsel’s investigation in any way,” Mr. Schumer said.</p> <p>The strained relations between the West and Russia reached a breaking point with the March 4 assassination attempt, which left the former spy, his daughter and a British police officer hospitalized with serious medical problems. Britain identified the nerve agent used as Novichok, which the Soviet military developed in the 1970s.</p> <p>Novichok is difficult to detect and it is believed to be 10 times more potent than other nerve agents such as VX and sarin.</p> <p>Mr. Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Scribal, 33, were found collapsed on a city bench in Salisbury, England, suffering from exposure to Novichok on March 4.</p> <p>In 2004, Mr. Skripal was convicted by the Russian government of spying for MI6 and accused of revealing the names of Russian agents working in the West.

But there is also fear that the heightened anger and antipathy toward Clinton, which last week included calls for her imprisonment and extrajudicial punishment, could be contagious. This is especially disturbing because of where that rhetoric inevitably led last week: to suggestions that someone should do the candidate physical harm.</p> <p>The most widely reported of these calls was made last week by Donald Trump’s adviser, delegate, and New Hampshire state representative Al Baldasaro, who said in a radio interview that Clinton “should be put on the firing line and shot for treason.” Baldasaro explained that he saw Clinton’s executable offenses as being linked to the right-wing furor over the Benghazi attack and Clinton’s email server: “She is a disgrace for the lies that she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in Benghazi. She dropped the ball on over 400 emails requesting backup security.”</p> <p>This strain of fury was stoked by prime-time convention speakers including Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in the Benghazi raid. “For all of this loss, for all of this grief, for all of the cynicism the tragedy in Benghazi has wrought upon America, I blame Hillary Clinton,” Smith said. “I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son.” (Since then, the mother of Ambassador J. Christopher Stephens has publicly asked the Trump campaign to stop invoking her son’s death in such an “opportunistic and cynical” way.)</p> <p>Baldasaro didn’t back down, but later amplified his calls for Clinton’s death, noting in a follow-up interview with BuzzFeed that, “anyone that commits treason should be shot … I believe Hillary committed treason.” This time, it seems, he was referring to the email scandal, claiming that “when people take confidential material off a server, you’re sharing information with the enemy. That’s treason.”</p> <p>Baldasaro was not alone in his calls for the death of the candidate who’s about to be the first woman ever nominated by a major party for the presidency. Earlier in the week, Michael Folk, a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, had tweeted at Clinton, “You should be tried for treason, murder and crimes against the U.S. Constitution…then hung on the Mall in Washington, D.C.”</p> <p>As several people on Twitter pointed out, this use of the language of treason, even without explicit calls for execution, is far from anodyne. Five thousand copies of a flyer depicting John F. Kennedy as “Wanted for Treason,” and enumerating his sins, which included appointing anti-Christians to federal office and telling “fantastic LIES to the American people,” were distributed in Dallas, Texas, in the days before his 1963 assassination.</p> <p>The allegations of treason, lying, and criminality seem to offer moral cover to those who really, really hate Clinton, who hate her so much that their loathing can only be satisfied by fantasies about her violent and public demise. It allows her harshest critics to feel that their desire to hurt her stems from patriotism, perhaps to reassure themselves that their hate is not misogynistic but rather a commitment to moral, righteous justice.</p> <p>On Friday, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani gave a speech in which he reiterated the claim that Clinton is a “criminal,” running not for office but to try to avoid “an orange jumpsuit,” and that if Donald Trump becomes president, he will “reopen the case.” Then, moving on to her electoral prospects, he felt comfortable using this language about her chances at the polls: “Hillary, we’re going to kill you in upstate New York.” According to Politico, he raised his voice and added, “We’re going to take you out in New York.”</p> <p>The language of physical harm is catching. When NPR’s “The Takeaway” reported from Cleveland bars last Thursday night after Trump’s speech, they interviewed a GOP vice-chair who slurred, “We’re building coalitions of the Asians, of the Orthodox Jews, Italians, Irish,” before growling, “We’re gonna hurt her.” The “Takeaway” hosts were briefly taken aback but then laughed off how much these jubilant, aggressive hordes had had to drink.</p> <p>All of this is why it is particularly alarming, as the Democratic convention kicks off in Philadelphia, to see protesters on the left voice their dismay with Clinton using the same “Lock her up!” chants and signs that say, “Hillary for Prison.” It’s why it’s so disconcerting to hear Green Party candidate Jill Stein stoke those protesters convictions that Hillary is a lawbreaker by telling them, as she did on Sunday, that she will urge Bernie Sanders to withdraw his endorsement of Clinton “based on the outright, purposeful sabotage of your campaign by the DNC and by Hillary Clinton.”</p> <p>The left certainly has its own longstanding, legitimate beefs with the candidate — about her vote to invade Iraq; her hawkishness; her position on Palestine; her relationship to banks; her support of her husband’s 1990s legislation, including the crime bill and welfare reform; her tendency toward safe centrism, as seen in her decision to pick Tim Kaine as her running mate as opposed to Elizabeth Warren or Sherrod Brown. But none of these issues are what’s being invoked when crowds of purported lefties shout about unproven crimes, fraud, rigging, sabotage, or when they cheer for Clinton’s imprisonment.</p> <p>Some progressives are eager to turn the hacked DNC emails into a scandal that proves malfeasance that thereby delegitimizes primary results, but it does no such thing. In fact, the email hack, as embarrassing as it might be, provides ample evidence that there was no rigging of the primary process by the DNC. There were a bunch of people who worked for the Democratic Party who hated Sanders, who hadn’t been a member of the party for very long, and who was seriously challenging the party favorite. They didn’t do anything about it. The one guy who suggested, horribly, that they attack Sanders on his lack of faith got shot down. It should now be abundantly clear that there was no systematic conspiracy to rob Sanders of the Democratic nomination. (And if there had been, it certainly could not have been pulled off by an organization that cannot tell its ass from its elbow. The only good news in all this is that Deborah Wasserman Schultz, who was not good at her job, is no longer in charge of the DNC.)</p> <p>When RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, tweets that “our election was stolen, rigged” and that Wasserman Schultz was not “acting on her own”; when progressives cheer for WikiLeaks, which yesterday retweeted Ann Coulter’s racism and some anti-Semitism of its own; when Democrats are chanting “Lock her up!” the language and objectives of left and right become increasingly indistinguishable.</p> <p>This isn’t issues-based dismay over Hillary Clinton, and if it once were, it has transformed into something far more grotesque and dangerous.

Ossoff’s losing 1.2 percent of Clinton’s GA-6 vote after the Democratic party put everything, emotionally and financially, on the line for a candidate they equated to their only remaining widely liked leader, has worrisome implications. Perhaps if the Democrats had put slightly less of a moral investment in this election, it would be seen for what it really is: a special election. But FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver aptly noted, “Sometimes dumb things matter if everyone agrees that they matter.”</p> <p>With taxpayer-subsidized Planned Parenthood dumping nearly $735,000 into Ossoff’s campaign and the DCCC pouring in over $5 million, Republicans turned out to vote in record numbers. Ultimately, for Georgia voters the election was less of a referendum on Trump than a rejection of an untried carpetbagger.</p>",The result left President Trump and other Republicans crowing and Democrats shaking their heads.,{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,Center,Right,NotByCenter,091773c9-9457-4534-b764-d19057a39204,,,,,,,,

And the plant closed in December 2008 -- while George W.

But he didn't mention that his own budget plan relies on those very same savings.</p> <p>Ryan also put responsibility for Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. government debt at Obama's doorstep.

That process of raising the debt ceiling was only politicized in the last Congress, driven by House Republicans, led in the charge by Paul Ryan.</p> <p>The credit rater also said it worried that Republicans would never agree to tax increases. “We have changed our assumption on [revenue] because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues,” S&P wrote.</p> <p>Jodie Layton, a convention goer from Utah watching the Ryan speech, said she was blown away by the vice presidential candidate.

And the plant closed in December 2008 -- while George W. Bush was president.</p> <p>It was just one of several striking and demonstrably misleading elements of Ryan's much-anticipated acceptance speech. And it comes just days after Romney pollster Neil Newhouse warned, defending the campaign's demonstrably false ads claiming Obama removed work requirements from welfare, ""We're not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.""</p> <p>Ryan, for his part, slammed the president for not supporting a deficit commission report without mentioning that he himself had voted against it, helping to kill it.</p> <p>He also made a cornerstone of his argument the claim that Obama ""funneled"" $716 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare. But he didn't mention that his own budget plan relies on those very same savings.</p> <p>Ryan also put responsibility for Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. government debt at Obama's doorstep. But he didn't mention that S&P itself, in explaining its downgrade, referred to the debt ceiling standoff. That process of raising the debt ceiling was only politicized in the last Congress, driven by House Republicans, led in the charge by Paul Ryan.</p> <p>The credit rater also said it worried that Republicans would never agree to tax increases. “We have changed our assumption on [revenue] because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues,” S&P wrote.</p> <p>Jodie Layton, a convention goer from Utah watching the Ryan speech, said she was blown away by the vice presidential candidate.

But if you think feminists and other Democrats are happy about a woman winning an election, if you think they’re celebrating this victory over rape culture and toxic masculinity and whatnot, you haven’t taken into account that the woman in question is a Republican.</p> <p>Here are just a few delicious morsels of post-election schadenfreude:</p> <p>At what point is this not a failure of Democrats but toxic, vindictive voters willing to elect hateful bigots? https://t.co/EYNDuzxzGL — Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) June 21, 2017</p> <p>One important lesson is that when they go low, going high doesn't f**king work. — Neera Tanden (@neeratanden) June 21, 2017</p> <p>Best thing that could come out of the #GA06 results is for Democratic Party to finally give up its self-destructive obsession with centrism — Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) June 21, 2017</p> <p>(Democrats: Please listen to Sally Kohn.)</p> <p>nothing to get too excited about when you realize it cost a republican 23 million dollars to keep a solid gop seat — Aminatou Sow (@aminatou) June 21, 2017</p> <p>Anyone who understands how profoundly 30 years of conservative media framing has altered America isn't surprised by GOP victories. #GA06 — Peter Daou (@peterdaou) June 21, 2017</p> <p>Tomorrow we start doing the work again…at least, those of us who understand the phrase, “nevertheless, she persisted."" — Karoli (@Karoli) June 21, 2017</p> <p>Yes, that’s exactly what Karen Handel did. No matter what the Dems threw at her, she persisted nevertheless.</p> <p>A woman shatters the glass ceiling, and the same people who told you to vote for Hillary Clinton whether or not you like her or agree with her — based solely on her genitalia — are super-bummed. The same people who called you a misogynist for refusing to vote for a woman are angry that another woman won something. It’s almost as if Democrats’ ideals and principles are disposable when they interfere with their political goals.</p> <p>Almost!</p>",The result left President Trump and other Republicans crowing and Democrats shaking their heads.,Outraged<marker>maybe that was a problem.<marker>,{},0,2.5,0|5,1.25,Right,Right,Right,Correct,12a2cac7-29e3-4c16-af08-44d81096949d,,,,,,,,

Speaking to Fusion’s Jorge Ramos in February, Mr. Fox said, “I’m not going to pay for that f–—g wall.</p> <p>Mr. Trump then called on the former Mexican president to apologize, which Mr. Foxobliged Wednesday after Mr. Trump’s GOP rivals dropped out of the race.</p> <p>“I apologize,” Mr. Fox told Breitbart News. “Forgiveness is one of the greatest qualities that human beings have, is the quality of a compassionate leader. You have to be humble. You have to be compassionate. You have to love thy neighbor.</p> <p>“If I offended you, I’m sorry. But what about the other way around?” he asked. “I don’t think he should follow the strategy of attacking others, offending others, to get to his purpose. There are other ways and means of doing it.”</p> <p>Mr. Fox said later on Fox News’ “The O’Reilly Factor”: “I think it’s very important to invite Donald Trump to come to Mexico and to learn about the real Mexico.”</p> <p>Mr. Trump, who appeared on the show shortly after Mr. Fox, responded, “Get your money ready ‘cause you’re going to pay for the wall,” Breitbart News reported.</p> <p>“We lose a fortune with Mexico, trade deficit $58 billion a year,” he said. “The wall’s going to cost $10 [billion]. Believe me, they’ll be able to afford it, and we’re going to end up having a very good relationship with Mexico. But right now, sadly, like everybody else, they’re taking advantage of our country on trade, and at the border. So, we’ll get it straightened out.”</p> <p>Copyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

Worse, for defenders of race-conscious programs, Justice Elena Kagan was recused from Fisher, so Justice Antonin Scalia’s recent death appeared unlikely to change the outcome in this case.</p> <p>At yet, affirmative action will survive. As ThinkProgress quipped shortly after the second round of Supreme Court oral arguments in Fisher, Justice Kennedy spent the entirety of this litigation playing the role of the Dread Pirate Roberts from Rob Reiner’s classic film The Princess Bride. In that film, the Dread Pirate keeps a captive alive, telling him each night that “I’ll most likely kill you in the morning.” Yet in the end, the pirate does not kill his captive, instead turning over his ship and his title to the new Dread Pirate.</p> <p>As it was in the movies, so it was Thursday in the Supreme Court — sort of. Though Kennedy appeared likely to kill affirmative action at many turns throughout this case, he cast the key fourth vote to uphold it over the dissents of his three most conservative colleagues. But, while Fisher is a victory for affirmative action, it is only a partial one. Kennedy’s opinion makes it clear that universities have a high and ongoing burden if they want to maintain affirmative action programs. It could also potentially inspire a rash of harassment suits targeting these programs.</p> <p>The University of Texas’ admissions system, as Kennedy notes, is unusual. About three-quarters of the class is admitted through a “Top Ten Percent Plan,” which admits all Texas high school students in the top ten percent (or, more recently, about the top eight percent) regardless of their other qualifications. This plan does admit some students of color, but it only achieved fairly marginal diversity. In 2002, for example, before the university implemented the affirmative action program that was challenged in Fisher, “52 percent of undergraduate classes with at least five students had no African-American students enrolled in them, and 27 percent had only one African-American student.”</p> <p>Then, in 2003, the Supreme Court upheld an affirmative action program at the University of Michigan law school in Grutter v. Bollinger. As Grutter held, and as Kennedy reiterates in Thursday’s opinion, universities may consider race in admissions because racial diversity benefits all students. “Enrolling a diverse student body ‘promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables students to better understand persons of different races,’” Kennedy explains. “Equally important, ‘student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society.’”</p> <p>In the wake of Grutter, Texas decided that race would be one of a myriad of factors that would play a minor role in determining who was admitted among the 25 percent of students who were not admitted by the Top Ten Percent plan. Kennedy’s opinion holds that Texas did not violate the Constitution when they decided to consider race in this way.</p> <p>So that’s the good news for affirmative action. The bad news is that Kennedy’s opinion also imposes tough and continuing burdens on universities that wish to implement similar affirmative action programs. “Because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,” Kennedy explains, “race may not be considered [by a university] unless the admissions process can withstand” the highest level of constitutional scrutiny. In practice, that means that “through regular evaluation of data and consideration of student experience, the University must tailor its approach in light of changing circumstances, ensuring that race plays no greater role than is necessary to meet its compelling interest.” An admissions policy that survives review today may no longer pass Kennedy’s test tomorrow.</p> <p>Kennedy also emphasizes just how many hoops Texas jumped through in order to produce an acceptable plan. The University of Texas “conducted ‘months of study and deliberation, including retreats, interviews, [and] review of data.’” This review culminated in a “39-page proposal” that “was written following a year-long study, which concluded that ‘[t]he use of race-neutral policies and programs ha[d] not been successful’ in ‘provid[ing] an educational setting that fosters cross-racial understanding, provid[ing] enlightened discussion and learning, [or] prepar[ing] students to function in an increasingly diverse workforce and society.’”</p> <p>So, while other universities remain free to implement affirmative action programs after Fisher, they will need to jump through similar hoops. And even if they succeed in doing so, they still have an “ongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies.” It is easy to imagine how conservative litigators can turn this obligation into an opportunity to harass universities with expensive suits designed to wear down the school’s commitment to affirmative action.</p> <p>In the meantime, however, affirmative action survives another day.

So, the key question that ought to be addressed in any health care reform legislation, is are we going to continue job lock, or are we going to allow individuals more choice, and portability to fit the 21st century workforce?” [Paul Ryan, 5/20/2009]</p> <p>— “Today, leaving a job or changing jobs means leav­ing behind the health insurance provided at the place of work. Individuals who wish to take a better job, change careers, or leave the workforce to raise a family or to retire early take substantial risks. […] Under the McCain plan, which links tax breaks directly to individuals instead of to their place of work, individuals would no longer feel obligated to stay with their employers simply because they need to keep their employer-based health insurance. [Heritage Foundation, 10/15/2008]</p> <p>— “Of course there are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I’m going to put in place…. I also want individuals to be able to buy insurance, health insurance, on their own as opposed to only being able to get it on a tax advantage basis through their company.” [Mitt Romney, 9/9/2012]</p> <p>— “[T]he employer-based system leads to ‘job lock,’ whereby people are afraid to leave their jobs if they fall ill on the job, because switching plans could mean higher premiums or denial of coverage.” [Avik Roy, former health care adviser to Mitt Romney, 2/7/2012]</p> <p>In other words, ensuring that an older person who stays in a job for its health care coverage can retire sooner or that a mother can leave her job to take care of a sick child, or an entrepreneur can can quit secure employment and start a new business have long been bipartisan goals. Democrats have sought to give Americans more options though the health care law’s exchanges and Medicaid expansion while Republican health care proposals focus on ending the favorable tax treatment of employer-sponsored health care and providing individuals with tax credits to buy their own health insurance on the individual market, across state lines.</p> <p>Academic research has quantified the cost of keeping health care coverage connected to the workplace. In 2008, researchers at Harvard estimated that there are “11 million people who would like to change jobs but are locked into their current job simply to keep their insurance,” while other studies have found that “job-to-job mobility is estimated to increase by as much as 25 percent when alternative group coverage is available.”</p> <p>As Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) explained in 2008, while rolling out the health care proposal that animated his presidential campaign, “’job lock’ reduces opportunities for American workers because they often pass up new jobs for fear of losing their health care coverage.” The health care law will start to change that predicament.</p> <p>Update:</p> <p>Sen.

Pat Smith has repeatedly said Clinton blamed the anti-Muslim video for inspiring the Benghazi attacks, a charge Clinton has denied.</p> <p>“Since then, I have repeatedly asked Hillary Clinton to explain to me the real reason why my son is dead,” Smith said during her RNC speech. “I’m still waiting.”</p> <p>But Clinton said during a Sunday interview on “Fox News Sunday” that Smith must not have correctly remembered their conversation during the 2012 ceremony.</p> <p>“As other members of families who lost loved ones have said, that’s not what they heard,” Clinton said. “I don’t hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall everything that was or wasn’t said.”</p> <p>Clinton’s response is nothing new. During a March Democratic debate, Clinton said of Smith, “I can’t imagine the grief she has about losing her son. But she’s wrong. She’s absolutely wrong.”</p> <p>But the Clinton-Smith back-and-forth has seen little coverage as opposed to the attention given to the aftermath of Khan’s Thursday speech at the Democratic National Convention, when the father of dead soldier Capt. Humayun Khan rebuked Trump for his proposed Muslim immigration ban.</p> <p>Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2016</p> <p>The squabble between Trump and Khan has morphed into a multi-day drama as Khan has continued appearing on news shows criticizing Trump and Trump has responded via his Twitter account, TV interviews and official campaign statements. Khan has said Trump is a “black soul” and Trump has responded that Khan had “no right” to criticize him on a national stage.</p> <p>The public quarrel has drawn strong reactions from many top Republicans, who have praised Capt. Khan’s sacrifice and scolded Trump for his rhetoric. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., delivered a stinging critique on Monday morning, saying that “while our Party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us.”</p>",Donald Trump continues to be attacked by Gold Star families and some in the GOP for his comments to the father of a slain Muslim U.S. solider.

The volatile regime launched a missile that flew over Japan before it splashed down into the sea last week.</p> <p>Trump issued a stern response to the tests early August and vowed to unleash ""fire and fiery.""</p> <p>In return, North Korea said it intended to attack Guam, a U.S. territory and the home to key U.S. military bases. The North eventually pulled back its ""plan"" to launch missiles toward Guam, though Kim eerily said last week's missile launch was a ""meaningful prelude"" to eventually containing the U.S. territory.</p> <p>David Albright, President of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, wrote in a report last month ""developing thermonuclear weapons was declared priority of North Korea.""</p> <p>""It appears capable of developing thermonuclear weapons. It is far more likely to be working on one-stage thermonuclear weapons rather than traditional two-stage thermonuclear weapons, or 'H-Bombs,'"" Albright wrote.</p> <p>Sunday's test was estimated to have a yield of 100 kilotons, meaning a blast that was four to five times more powerful than the explosion in Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945, a South Korean defense official told the country's Yonhap News Agency.</p> <p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>","Early today, North Korea tested what they claim to be a hydrogen bomb, a powerful nuclear weapon. This is not their first nuclear test, but the device was much more powerful than the last one they tested. This test comes amid a time of high tensions among North Korea and the rest of the world as North Korea has run several missile tests in the last few months.",<marker>,{},0,0,6,0,Center,Right,Right,Correct,1a601803-2c78-41e0-9ae3-8dd61e315437,,,,,,,,

But recent events have propelled the story into the presidential campaign.</p> <p>First, in Cleveland, Trump’s campaign, which had generally steered clear of platform disputes, threw around its weight to block a plank endorsing defensive military aide to Ukraine. Next, Trump shocked the foreign-policy Establishment by telling reporters that, contrary to decades of American policy, he might renege on America’s commitment to defend NATO allies in the event of a Russian invasion. And then, last weekend, emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been hacked by Russia appeared on WikiLeaks. The emails, which showed staffers pulling for Hillary Clinton despite the organization’s professed neutrality, created a rift between bitter supporters of Bernie Sanders and the party Establishment at a time when it was trying to tamp down discord in the service of concord. Clinton’s campaign manager is now stating openly that Russia is trying to help Trump.</p> <p>And oddly enough, the drama is having a second-order effect that is more profound than the direct hit from the email story. It is prying open a deep, decades-old ideological wedge between liberals and the left at just the moment when the two wings were seeking to form a united front against Trump.</p> <p>What is the relationship between Trump and Russia? That Russia is pulling for Trump is at this point beyond any dispute. The Kremlin’s English-language propaganda channel RT and Russia’s army of Twitter trolls, as well as Russia’s internal propaganda, have all thrown themselves behind the Republican candidate. A series of reports (here, here, and here) have shown that Russia backed the operation to hack the DNC. Adrien Chen, who reported last summer on Russia’s army of internet trolls that spreads disinformation abroad, noted in December that the trolls he was tracking had begun posing as pro-Trump conservatives.</p> <p>It is the other half of the equation that is more opaque. Putin is helping Trump, but what exactly is Trump giving him in return? As Foer notes, Trump’s habit of refusing to pay back people who loan him money means regular American banks won’t lend him money anymore, making him dependent on unusual sources of financing. He has cultivated deep personal and financial ties with Russia — and to do major business with Russia, unlike a reasonably free economy, is to do business with its ruling claque. Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, helped orchestrate Putin’s intervention in Ukraine. His Russia adviser Carter Page has deep ties to Russia and owns stock in Gazprom, the state-controlled firm that is a major source of the Kremlin’s financial and economic power. Michael Flynn, another Trump adviser, appears regularly on RT and refused to answer questions about whether he is paid to do so. Trump and Putin have exchanged lavish compliments.</p> <p>Trump’s own financial ties to Russia are completely non-transparent and will remain so as long as he refuses to release his tax returns. With a normal candidate, the Russia connection would amount to a massive, disqualifying scandal. At minimum, the nominee would face overwhelming pressure to release his tax return — a standard requirement even without grounds for suspicion — to prove he is not getting paid by a hostile foreign power. To be clear, it is pretty improbable that Trump is literally working for Putin. But this hardly settles the question. First, for a risk as consequential as the willful penetration of the American government by a hostile power, “pretty improbable” is not improbable enough. Second, the more likely explanation for the web of ties between Trump and Putin is still fairly damning. You have a candidate with a long record of admiring despots in general and the Russian despot in particular, surrounded by advisers in his pay, and who is flamboyantly ignorant of policy. Given these circumstances, it would be hard to imagine how Trump could form views on Russia without Putin’s influence.</p> <p>But the accusation that Trump’s relationship with Russia reeks of impropriety, in the media now by Clinton, has provoked a furious counterattack on the left. Even the indisputable notion that Russia is trying to help Trump (far from the more explosive charge that Trump is trying to help Russia) has been assailed on the left as “McCarthyism” by figures like Katrina vandenHeuvel, Glenn Greenwald, and many others.</p> <p>The split runs along the same lines as the fissure between liberals and leftists dating from the origins of the Cold War. The Cold War began under the presidency of Harry Truman, a figure who was regarded by progressives of his era with emotions ranging from disappointment to outright disgust. That dismay propelled the third-party candidacy of Henry Wallace, who attracted a small but wildly enthusiastic following among idealists and the far left. Wallace lambasted Truman as a warmonger, a tool of Wall Street and big business, and a traitor to the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt (which, to the frustration of liberals, had stalled). Wallace depicted the Marshall Plan, the Berlin Airlift, and other Cold War policies as a plot to instigate World War III.</p> <p>Photo: MPI</p> <p>The hostility between Truman and the left of his era, I argued a couple of months ago, parallels the current dynamic between Clinton and the Bernie Sanders movement today. The Trump-Russia scandal has activated that same left-wing impulse. The American far left during Truman’s era, just like today, was not pro-Russia so much as it was anti-anti-Russia, and follows identical themes: Criticism of Russia’s domestic repression or aggressive foreign policy is merely a ploy to distract from and excuse America’s own failings, and provides dangerous support for American aggression, which could lead to war. So, just as the left of the ‘40s and ‘50s saw anti-Stalinism as an excuse for Jim Crow, a Glenn Greenwald today casts Russia’s human-rights record in an implausibly favorable light, and reflexively dismisses any contrary view as simple hypocrisy. When Russia menaces Ukraine, The Nation informs its audience that this is perfectly justifiable because Ukraine is not really a country at all.</p> <p>Trump’s pro-Russia tilt has reenergized these Cold War tropes. The left-wing writer Corey Robin heartily endorses the Republican nominee’s statement that “When the world sees how bad the United States is and we start talking about civil liberties, I don’t think we are a very good messenger.” And in response to liberals aghast at Trump’s renunciation of upholding America’s commitment to NATO, Robin sneers at “the prospect of sending the US military off to fight Putin or whomever it is we’re now supposed to be willing to fight over NATO.” To clear up Robin’s apparent confusion, “whomever it is we’re now supposed to be willing to fight over NATO” is in fact whoever invades the members of NATO, all of whom are pledged to defend each other in the event of an attack. And “now” is in fact since NATO was formed in 1949.</p> <p>Obviously, there are sound foreign-policy reasons for caution in American foreign policy toward Russia. Ukraine is not a NATO member, which explains why Russian incursions have not been met with a military response. The defining trait of the left’s anti-anti-Russia stance is not a reluctance to go to war, but an automatic habit of analyzing Russia’s behavior through the prism of American innocence and motivations, which are inevitably found wanting.</p> <p>For whatever reason, Trump is the candidate who has given the most forthright expression to anti-anti-Russian beliefs of any candidate since circa 1948 Henry Wallace (just as he has given the most open expression of racist beliefs of any candidate since circa 1968 George Wallace). As the acrimony between Clinton-supporting liberals and their foes on the left spills out on the streets of Philadelphia, this historical irony is playing a minor role. The far left’s willingness to play into the opposing party’s hands displays not only its continued disgust with the Democratic Party’s nominee and Establishment, but a certain convergence of thought with the Republican nominee.</p> <p>Update: The Nation has an editorial denouncing defending Trump’s relationship with Russia, under the headline “Against Neo-McCarthyism.” The Nation’s in-house Russophile Stephen F. Cohen echoes those views. The editorial hinges upon a loose definition of “McCarthyism,” a term I would use to mean “false accusations of disloyalty,” but which The Nation uses to mean “any accusation of being in agreement with Russia, whether true or not.”</p> <p>The editorial asserts, “nobody has conclusively proven who hacked into the DNC’s network.” “Conclusive proof” is a pretty difficult standard, in the absence of a signed, notarized confession from Vladimir Putin. What we do have is the strong belief of experts both inside and outside the American government.</p> <p>The editorial likewise argues that poor Trump is being smeared because he wisely opposes arming Ukraine:</p> <p>To be sure, the GOP candidate has suggested that he may pursue a policy of détente with Russia. He also, in our view wisely, threw out a reckless plank in the Republican platform that pledged to further arm Kiev. But Trump is only following the lead of the current administration. Should we assert seditious links between President Obama’s policy and the Kremlin?</p> <p>The editorial fails to mention nearly all the disturbing evidence of Trump’s unusually deep ties to the Russian regime, including the financial ties between his advisers and the regime, Trump’s repudiation of NATO, extensive praise for Putin, and the drumbeat of pro-Trump propaganda from Russia’s media. Instead, the editorial assumes that any questioning of a politician’s ties to Russia is McCarthyism by definition.</p> <p>Inconveniently for The Nation, its anti-McCarthyism editorial seems to have been written before, but published after, the subject of its defense openly pleaded with Russia to violate American law on his behalf. The editorial laments, “liberal-media elites have joined with the Clinton campaign in promoting the narrative of a devious Russian cyber-attack.” Now Trump is also promoting this narrative – only, rather than calling it devious, it’s his actual policy.</p>","The opening was unruly, with the firing of the DNC Chairman and unruly Sanders supporters.

What we do have is the strong belief of experts both inside and outside the American government.</p> <p>The editorial likewise argues that poor Trump is being smeared because he wisely opposes arming Ukraine:</p> <p>To be sure, the GOP candidate has suggested that he may pursue a policy of détente with Russia. He also, in our view wisely, threw out a reckless plank in the Republican platform that pledged to further arm Kiev. But Trump is only following the lead of the current administration. Should we assert seditious links between President Obama’s policy and the Kremlin?</p> <p>The editorial fails to mention nearly all the disturbing evidence of Trump’s unusually deep ties to the Russian regime, including the financial ties between his advisers and the regime, Trump’s repudiation of NATO, extensive praise for Putin, and the drumbeat of pro-Trump propaganda from Russia’s media. Instead, the editorial assumes that any questioning of a politician’s ties to Russia is McCarthyism by definition.</p> <p>Inconveniently for The Nation, its anti-McCarthyism editorial seems to have been written before, but published after, the subject of its defense openly pleaded with Russia to violate American law on his behalf. The editorial laments, “liberal-media elites have joined with the Clinton campaign in promoting the narrative of a devious Russian cyber-attack.” Now Trump is also promoting this narrative – only, rather than calling it devious, it’s his actual policy.</p>","The opening was unruly, with the firing of the DNC Chairman and unruly Sanders supporters.

In recent years, however, some criminals have illegally converted semi-automatic weapons into automatic ones.</p> <p>Chris Michel, owner of Dixie GunWorx, said Paddock visited his store in St. George, Utah, several times and purchased a shotgun in February after passing a federal gun background check.</p> <p>""There were no red flags,"" Michel told The Associated Press. ""I had no idea he would be capable of this.""</p> <p>Paddock had been in the hotel room since September 28, according to Lombardo. The sheriff said a check of federal and state databases showed Paddock was not on law enforcement authorities' radar before the bloodbath.</p> <p>Authorities said two on-duty Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers were injured during the shooting. One is in stable condition after surgery, and the other sustained minor injuries. Two off-duty police officers attending the concert were killed.</p> <p>President Trump said the mass shooting ""was an act of pure evil,"" and praised first responders in an address to the nation.</p> <p>""To the families of the victims, we are praying for you and we are here for you,"" Trump said, adding that he will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with first responders and families.</p> <p>The gunman, who fired down on the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a room in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound just as police made entry to the room, according to LVMPD undersheriff Kevin McMahill.</p> <p>At this time, federal officials do not see any connection to international terrorism and little is known about Paddock's motivation, federal law enforcement sources said. The Islamic State terror group took credit for the Las Vegas shooting, saying the gunman converted to Islam months ago, but provided no evidence to back up the claim.</p> <p>FBI Special agent-in-charge Aaron Rouse said at a news conference the agency has ""determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group.""</p> <p>Clark County Commission Chair Steve Sisola told the Nevada Independent that Paddock rented two hotel rooms, one facing north and one facing east, and had previously visited the hotel two other times.</p> <p>Paddock was using Danley’s slot machine card, which is how police got ahold of her name although she was in the Philippines at the time of the incident, Sisolak said.</p> <p>The gunman's brother, Eric Paddock, told reporters outside his Central Florida home early Monday ""an asteroid just fell on us,"" and said Stephen Paddock has no history of mental illness.</p> <p>Paddock said his brother is ""just a guy"" and he ""freaked,"" and had retired to Vegas because he liked gambling. The shooter's brother said Paddock didn't care about religion or politics.</p> <p>He later told reporters that his brother was a multimillionaire who made money investing in real estate, in addition to working as an accountant for a number of years.</p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security said Monday morning that the department is ""closely monitoring"" and helping partners investigate the tragedy, but at this time has ""no information to indicate a specific credible threat involving other public venues in the country.""</p> <p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke with Sheriff Lombardo offering his full support, Department of Justice officials told Fox News.</p> <p>Sessions said in a statement he met with FBI Director Christopher Wray early Monday morning.</p> <p>""To the many families whose lives have been changed forever by this heinous act, we offer you our prayers and our promise that we will do everything in our power to get justice for your loved ones,"" Sessions said in a statement.</p> <p>Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval called the massacre a cowardly, despicable act and praised first responders, saying they saved scores of lives.</p> <p>""We're angry, we're grieving, we're confused, people are hurting,"" he said.</p> <p>Authorities first received calls about an active shooting at about 10:08 p.m. Country music star Jason Aldean was performing at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the gunfire erupted.</p> <p>Aldean was performing his last song of the night. Initially, those in attendance said they thought the sound was firecrackers. But as the shots continued, Aldean stopped singing and some concertgoers could be heard yelling to each other to get down.</p> <p>One witness told a local television station that he heard “hundreds of shots.” The gunfire was rapid and reportedly confused with firecrackers.</p> <p>""It sounded like a machine gun,"" one vendor told Fox News. ""It sounded like more than one machine gun.""</p> <p>Firearms experts hesitated Monday to attribute the shooter’s rapid fire from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino to an automatic weapon’s fire.</p> <p>Automatic weapons, sometimes referred to as machine guns, fire a stream of bullets when the trigger is pulled once and held down. They differ from semiautomatic weapons, which require one trigger pull for each round fired.</p> <p>Ryan Cleckner, a former U.S. Army Ranger sniper and author of “Long Range Shooting Handbook,” said the seemingly inconsistent rate of Paddock’s shooting may indicate he was using a device to mimic full-auto fire.</p> <p>These devices, such as a Slide Fire stock, are legal and can be bought for about $300.</p> <p>""These devices take advantage of a firearm’s natural recoil to ‘bump-fire’ the firearm thereby mimicking a machine gun without meeting the legal definition,” Cleckner told Fox News.</p> <p>Equipping an AR-15, for example, with a Slide Fire stock would be far cheaper and easier than buying a machine gun. Machine guns in the U.S. can cost upwards of $15,000 and require the buyer to undergo a personally intrusive and months-long application process with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p> <p>Country singer Jake Owen, who performed before Aldean, told Fox News the gunfire was ""non-stop.""</p> <p>""You couldn't tell where it was coming from. It was loud and non-stop,"" he said.</p> <p>Some concertgoers stayed behind to offer help to those around them.</p> <p>“Everybody I saw breathing, I helped,” a concertgoer told Fox News.</p> <p>The wife of a Tennessee man killed by the Las Vegas shooter said her husband died because he saved her from being shot. Heather Gulish Melton told Fox affiliate WZTV that her husband, Sonny Melton of Paris, Tennessee, was among the 50 killed Sunday night.</p> <p>Kodiak Yazzie, 36, said the music stopped temporarily and started up again before another round of pops sent the performers ducking for cover and fleeing the stage.</p> <p>""It was the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my entire life,"" Yazzie told the Associated Press. ""You could hear that the noise was coming from west of us, from Mandalay Bay. You could see a flash- flash- flash- flash.""</p> <p>As the thousands of fans in the crowd began to flee, Yazzie took cover and said he saw flashes of light coming from the Mandalay Bay hotel tower high above.</p> <p>Another concertgoer told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the shots sounded like fireworks, and she hid in a sewer.</p> <p>“It was a horror show,” Ivetta Saldana told the newspaper. “People were standing around, then they hit the floor.”</p> <p>Retired FBI special agent and former national FBI spokesman John Iannarelli, who drove past the scene of the event just moments before the shooting took place, told Fox News the massacre was ""obviously well-planned.""</p> <p>Iannarelli added the gunman used “expensive guns and ammunition.”</p> <p>Iannarelli noted that FBI and police are going to speak with every friend and relative, and are conducting forensic review of the suspect's computers and phones.</p> <p>The shooting at the sold-out Route 91 Harvest festival was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Forty-nine people were killed when a gunman opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016.</p> <p>Sunday's shooting came more than four months after a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people. Almost 90 people were killed by gunmen inspired by the Islamic State terror group at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris during a performance by Eagles of Death Metal in November 2015.</p>","Many politicians, members of the media, and other public figures are offering condolences as well as opinions in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 58 dead and 500 others injured in Las Vegas Sunday night.

Police initially sought a woman believed to be Paddock's roommate, Marilou Danley, as a ""person of interest."" Detectives later made contact with her, and ""do not believe she is involved with the shooting on The Strip.""</p> <p>Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said an ""excess of 10 rifles"" were found in the room, but did not immediately reveal a motive, saying ""I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.""</p> <p>Paddock reportedly had about 23 guns in his hotel room, according to police in an evening press conference.</p> <p>Fully automatic weapons produced after the mid-1980s are illegal in the U.S. Those made before can still be purchased, however, buying one requires heavy regulation, including a background check by ATF and law enforcement notification. In recent years, however, some criminals have illegally converted semi-automatic weapons into automatic ones.</p> <p>Chris Michel, owner of Dixie GunWorx, said Paddock visited his store in St. George, Utah, several times and purchased a shotgun in February after passing a federal gun background check.</p> <p>""There were no red flags,"" Michel told The Associated Press. ""I had no idea he would be capable of this.""</p> <p>Paddock had been in the hotel room since September 28, according to Lombardo. The sheriff said a check of federal and state databases showed Paddock was not on law enforcement authorities' radar before the bloodbath.</p> <p>Authorities said two on-duty Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers were injured during the shooting. One is in stable condition after surgery, and the other sustained minor injuries. Two off-duty police officers attending the concert were killed.</p> <p>President Trump said the mass shooting ""was an act of pure evil,"" and praised first responders in an address to the nation.</p> <p>""To the families of the victims, we are praying for you and we are here for you,"" Trump said, adding that he will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with first responders and families.</p> <p>The gunman, who fired down on the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a room in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound just as police made entry to the room, according to LVMPD undersheriff Kevin McMahill.</p> <p>At this time, federal officials do not see any connection to international terrorism and little is known about Paddock's motivation, federal law enforcement sources said. The Islamic State terror group took credit for the Las Vegas shooting, saying the gunman converted to Islam months ago, but provided no evidence to back up the claim.</p> <p>FBI Special agent-in-charge Aaron Rouse said at a news conference the agency has ""determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group.""</p> <p>Clark County Commission Chair Steve Sisola told the Nevada Independent that Paddock rented two hotel rooms, one facing north and one facing east, and had previously visited the hotel two other times.</p> <p>Paddock was using Danley’s slot machine card, which is how police got ahold of her name although she was in the Philippines at the time of the incident, Sisolak said.</p> <p>The gunman's brother, Eric Paddock, told reporters outside his Central Florida home early Monday ""an asteroid just fell on us,"" and said Stephen Paddock has no history of mental illness.</p> <p>Paddock said his brother is ""just a guy"" and he ""freaked,"" and had retired to Vegas because he liked gambling. The shooter's brother said Paddock didn't care about religion or politics.</p> <p>He later told reporters that his brother was a multimillionaire who made money investing in real estate, in addition to working as an accountant for a number of years.</p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security said Monday morning that the department is ""closely monitoring"" and helping partners investigate the tragedy, but at this time has ""no information to indicate a specific credible threat involving other public venues in the country.""</p> <p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke with Sheriff Lombardo offering his full support, Department of Justice officials told Fox News.</p> <p>Sessions said in a statement he met with FBI Director Christopher Wray early Monday morning.</p> <p>""To the many families whose lives have been changed forever by this heinous act, we offer you our prayers and our promise that we will do everything in our power to get justice for your loved ones,"" Sessions said in a statement.</p> <p>Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval called the massacre a cowardly, despicable act and praised first responders, saying they saved scores of lives.</p> <p>""We're angry, we're grieving, we're confused, people are hurting,"" he said.</p> <p>Authorities first received calls about an active shooting at about 10:08 p.m. Country music star Jason Aldean was performing at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the gunfire erupted.</p> <p>Aldean was performing his last song of the night. Initially, those in attendance said they thought the sound was firecrackers. But as the shots continued, Aldean stopped singing and some concertgoers could be heard yelling to each other to get down.</p> <p>One witness told a local television station that he heard “hundreds of shots.” The gunfire was rapid and reportedly confused with firecrackers.</p> <p>""It sounded like a machine gun,"" one vendor told Fox News. ""It sounded like more than one machine gun.""</p> <p>Firearms experts hesitated Monday to attribute the shooter’s rapid fire from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino to an automatic weapon’s fire.</p> <p>Automatic weapons, sometimes referred to as machine guns, fire a stream of bullets when the trigger is pulled once and held down. They differ from semiautomatic weapons, which require one trigger pull for each round fired.</p> <p>Ryan Cleckner, a former U.S. Army Ranger sniper and author of “Long Range Shooting Handbook,” said the seemingly inconsistent rate of Paddock’s shooting may indicate he was using a device to mimic full-auto fire.</p> <p>These devices, such as a Slide Fire stock, are legal and can be bought for about $300.</p> <p>""These devices take advantage of a firearm’s natural recoil to ‘bump-fire’ the firearm thereby mimicking a machine gun without meeting the legal definition,” Cleckner told Fox News.</p> <p>Equipping an AR-15, for example, with a Slide Fire stock would be far cheaper and easier than buying a machine gun. Machine guns in the U.S. can cost upwards of $15,000 and require the buyer to undergo a personally intrusive and months-long application process with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p> <p>Country singer Jake Owen, who performed before Aldean, told Fox News the gunfire was ""non-stop.""</p> <p>""You couldn't tell where it was coming from. It was loud and non-stop,"" he said.</p> <p>Some concertgoers stayed behind to offer help to those around them.</p> <p>“Everybody I saw breathing, I helped,” a concertgoer told Fox News.</p> <p>The wife of a Tennessee man killed by the Las Vegas shooter said her husband died because he saved her from being shot. Heather Gulish Melton told Fox affiliate WZTV that her husband, Sonny Melton of Paris, Tennessee, was among the 50 killed Sunday night.</p> <p>Kodiak Yazzie, 36, said the music stopped temporarily and started up again before another round of pops sent the performers ducking for cover and fleeing the stage.</p> <p>""It was the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my entire life,"" Yazzie told the Associated Press. ""You could hear that the noise was coming from west of us, from Mandalay Bay. You could see a flash- flash- flash- flash.""</p> <p>As the thousands of fans in the crowd began to flee, Yazzie took cover and said he saw flashes of light coming from the Mandalay Bay hotel tower high above.</p> <p>Another concertgoer told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the shots sounded like fireworks, and she hid in a sewer.</p> <p>“It was a horror show,” Ivetta Saldana told the newspaper. “People were standing around, then they hit the floor.”</p> <p>Retired FBI special agent and former national FBI spokesman John Iannarelli, who drove past the scene of the event just moments before the shooting took place, told Fox News the massacre was ""obviously well-planned.""</p> <p>Iannarelli added the gunman used “expensive guns and ammunition.”</p> <p>Iannarelli noted that FBI and police are going to speak with every friend and relative, and are conducting forensic review of the suspect's computers and phones.</p> <p>The shooting at the sold-out Route 91 Harvest festival was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Forty-nine people were killed when a gunman opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016.</p> <p>Sunday's shooting came more than four months after a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people. Almost 90 people were killed by gunmen inspired by the Islamic State terror group at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris during a performance by Eagles of Death Metal in November 2015.</p>","Many politicians, members of the media, and other public figures are offering condolences as well as opinions in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 58 dead and 500 others injured in Las Vegas Sunday night. Many people on the Left are calling for stricter gun legislation and for Congress to act quickly in response to the shooting.

Flynn had already been fired from his position in the administration over revelations that he misled Vice President Pence about his communications with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak.</p> <p>“When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the president began by saying, 'I want to talk about Mike Flynn,'"" Comey wrote in his opening statement.</p> <p>Comey wrote Trump, then said: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.""</p> <p>The former FBI director said he did not tell Trump he would stop the probe.</p> <p>Flynn, a retired general, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about his talks with Kislyak on Trump’s behalf. He was charged with one count of “willfully and knowingly” making false statements to the FBI.</p> <p>Trump, speaking to reporters on Saturday, reiterated there was “absolutely no collusion” with the Russians.</p> <p>“We will see what happens [with Flynn],” Trump said.</p>","In an early morning tweet, President Trump said that he ""never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn."" This is counter to Comey's testimony before Congress in which he claimed that Trump pressured him during an Oval Office meeting to stop investigating Flynn. This tweet came after the president tweeted on Saturday that he fired Flynn ""because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.""",{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,Center,Right,NotByCenter,2eb8dc69-f50b-4fb7-9bae-66850a181086,,,,,,,,

Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump implied that he believed Putin’s claim of innocence on the issue, which Trump said came up while the two leaders were chatting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam. The two had no formal meeting at the summit, but talked two or three times on the sidelines. It was during at least one of those conversations that Russia’s election meddling was broached, according to Trump.","This time, Putin’s press secretary denied that the topic even came up while Putin and Trump chatted at the Asia summit, and the Kremlin said that the leaders had only discussed Syria and “confirmed their determination to defeat ISIS” in the country, per a joint statement released by Russia. As far as Putin himself, he remarked on Saturday that U.S.-Russia relations “have not come out of the crisis state yet,” but that “we are prepared to turn the page and go forward to look into the future to solve the problems that are of interest to people of the United States and people of the Russian Federation.” The ongoing Russia investigation in the U.S. is only “a manifestation of a continuing domestic political struggle,” according to Putin. On that point, Trump and Putin have always been in agreement.","<p>Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev/AFP/Sputnik/Getty Images</p> <p>President Trump suggested on Saturday that Russian president Vladimir Putin is more trustworthy than America’s intelligence agencies on the matter of whether Russia interfered in last year’s U.S. presidential election. Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump implied that he believed Putin’s claim of innocence on the issue, which Trump said came up while the two leaders were chatting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam. The two had no formal meeting at the summit, but talked two or three times on the sidelines. It was during at least one of those conversations that Russia’s election meddling was broached, according to Trump.</p> <p>“He said he didn’t meddle,” Trump said. “I asked him again. You can only ask so many times.”</p> <p>Though he dodged a question as to whether or not he fully believed Putin’s denials, it seemed clear that Trump was more than sympathetic to the Russian leader’s viewpoint. “Every time he sees me he says I didn’t do that and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,” Trump said, noting that he thinks Putin is “insulted” by the accusation, “which is not a good thing for our country.” Instead, echoing Putin’s consistent framing of the issue, Trump said that the meddling allegations were an “artificial Democratic hit job” and “artificial barrier” making it more difficult for the U.S. and Russia to work together on shared security issues like dealing with North Korea or Syria.</p> <p>“Having a good relationship with Russia is a great, great thing,” and this issue “gets in the way, and that’s a shame, because people will die” on account of the resulting inaction, Trump insisted.</p> <p>Of course, Trump and Putin’s much-ado-about-nothing assessment flies in the face of what the FBI, CIA, and NSA have concluded, but Trump seemed to write off that analysis on Saturday. According to Trump, Obama administration intelligence officials who were responsible for the assessment — like former FBI director James Comey, former CIA director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper — are “political hacks” whose opinions are apparently worth less than Putin’s.</p> <p>“Give me a break,” Trump complained to reporters, “You have Brennan, you have Clapper and you have Comey. Comey is proven now to be a liar and he is proven now to be a leaker. So you look at that and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with them.”</p> <p>Indeed, Trump seemed quite impressed by the strength of Putin’s statements, also remarking that, “He says that very strongly, he really seems to be insulted by it and he says he didn’t do it.

The two had no formal meeting at the summit, but talked two or three times on the sidelines. It was during at least one of those conversations that Russia’s election meddling was broached, according to Trump.</p> <p>“He said he didn’t meddle,” Trump said. “I asked him again. You can only ask so many times.”</p> <p>Though he dodged a question as to whether or not he fully believed Putin’s denials, it seemed clear that Trump was more than sympathetic to the Russian leader’s viewpoint. “Every time he sees me he says I didn’t do that and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,” Trump said, noting that he thinks Putin is “insulted” by the accusation, “which is not a good thing for our country.” Instead, echoing Putin’s consistent framing of the issue, Trump said that the meddling allegations were an “artificial Democratic hit job” and “artificial barrier” making it more difficult for the U.S. and Russia to work together on shared security issues like dealing with North Korea or Syria.</p> <p>“Having a good relationship with Russia is a great, great thing,” and this issue “gets in the way, and that’s a shame, because people will die” on account of the resulting inaction, Trump insisted.</p> <p>Of course, Trump and Putin’s much-ado-about-nothing assessment flies in the face of what the FBI, CIA, and NSA have concluded, but Trump seemed to write off that analysis on Saturday. According to Trump, Obama administration intelligence officials who were responsible for the assessment — like former FBI director James Comey, former CIA director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper — are “political hacks” whose opinions are apparently worth less than Putin’s.</p> <p>“Give me a break,” Trump complained to reporters, “You have Brennan, you have Clapper and you have Comey. Comey is proven now to be a liar and he is proven now to be a leaker. So you look at that and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with them.”</p> <p>Indeed, Trump seemed quite impressed by the strength of Putin’s statements, also remarking that, “He says that very strongly, he really seems to be insulted by it and he says he didn’t do it. He is very, very strong in the fact that he didn’t do it.”</p> <p>“I can’t stand there and argue with him,” Trump confessed, “I’d rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you.

The acerbic speech accused the president of leaving his legions of voters with little more than a record of squandered opportunities and broken promises as they stare at ""fading Obama posters"" and look for work.</p> <p>“It all started off with stirring speeches, Greek columns, the thrill of something new,” Ryan said. “Now all that’s left is a presidency adrift, surviving on slogans that already seem tired, grasping at a moment that has already passed, like a ship trying to sail on yesterday’s wind.”</p> <p>From start to finish, the speech was an unceasing assault on Obama’s record. By the end, he drew thunderous cheers and applause from the convention crowd. And as he has in the past, Ryan tried to draw a sharp contrast throughout.</p> <p>Obama’s term, he said, has been “a dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next, a government-planned life, a country where everything is free but us.”</p> <p>Ryan pledged a new direction: ""We will not duck the tough issues, we will lead.""</p> <p>He vowed to rein in the size of government, and called on the party to take the journey with them.</p> <p>“Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation’s economic problems,” Ryan said. “And I’m going to level with you. We don’t have that much time. But if we are serious, and smart, and we lead, we can do this.”</p> <p>Of the Democrats, he said, “Their moment came and went.”</p> <p>Ryan catalogued a litany of grievances against the president, from the stimulus and accompanying funding for companies like Solyndra -- “with their gold-plated connections … and make-believe markets” -- to the health care overhaul.</p> <p>His inner numbers-guy emerged as he tried to explain the disconnect between the economic crisis when Obama took office and Obama’s actions in those first couple years.</p> <p>“Here we were, faced with a massive job crisis – so deep that if everyone out of work stood in single file, that unemployment line would stretch the length of the entire American continent,” Ryan said. “You would think that any president, whatever his party, would make job creation, and nothing else, his first order of economic business.”</p> <p>He went on: “Instead, we got a long, divisive, all-or-nothing attempt to put the federal government in charge of health care.”</p> <p>Ryan also renewed the ticket’s pledge to repeal “ObamaCare” and continued to claim that he and Romney invite a debate about Medicare -- which Democrats have tried to use against Ryan because of his own controversial plan.</p> <p>But Ryan repeated the argument that the federal health care overhaul is the real danger for Medicare seniors because of the cuts it makes.</p> <p>“The greatest threat to Medicare is ObamaCare, and we’re going to stop it,” he said. “So our opponents can consider themselves on notice. In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the left isn’t going to work.”</p> <p>Ryan brought the crowd to its feet when he took the stage and again when he left it.</p> <p>""After four years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround,"" Ryan said at the top, ""and the man for the job is Gov. Mitt Romney.""</p> <p>Ryan’s speech sets the stage for Mitt Romney’s nomination acceptance speech Thursday, which will close out the party’s convention and be the GOP’s last word before Democrats convene in Charlotte, N.C., for their nomination gala.</p> <p>New Jersey Gov.

The acerbic speech accused the president of leaving his legions of voters with little more than a record of squandered opportunities and broken promises as they stare at ""fading Obama posters"" and look for work.</p> <p>“It all started off with stirring speeches, Greek columns, the thrill of something new,” Ryan said. “Now all that’s left is a presidency adrift, surviving on slogans that already seem tired, grasping at a moment that has already passed, like a ship trying to sail on yesterday’s wind.”</p> <p>From start to finish, the speech was an unceasing assault on Obama’s record. By the end, he drew thunderous cheers and applause from the convention crowd. And as he has in the past, Ryan tried to draw a sharp contrast throughout.</p> <p>Obama’s term, he said, has been “a dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next, a government-planned life, a country where everything is free but us.”</p> <p>Ryan pledged a new direction: ""We will not duck the tough issues, we will lead.""</p> <p>He vowed to rein in the size of government, and called on the party to take the journey with them.</p> <p>“Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation’s economic problems,” Ryan said. “And I’m going to level with you. We don’t have that much time. But if we are serious, and smart, and we lead, we can do this.”</p> <p>Of the Democrats, he said, “Their moment came and went.”</p> <p>Ryan catalogued a litany of grievances against the president, from the stimulus and accompanying funding for companies like Solyndra -- “with their gold-plated connections … and make-believe markets” -- to the health care overhaul.</p> <p>His inner numbers-guy emerged as he tried to explain the disconnect between the economic crisis when Obama took office and Obama’s actions in those first couple years.</p> <p>“Here we were, faced with a massive job crisis – so deep that if everyone out of work stood in single file, that unemployment line would stretch the length of the entire American continent,” Ryan said. “You would think that any president, whatever his party, would make job creation, and nothing else, his first order of economic business.”</p> <p>He went on: “Instead, we got a long, divisive, all-or-nothing attempt to put the federal government in charge of health care.”</p> <p>Ryan also renewed the ticket’s pledge to repeal “ObamaCare” and continued to claim that he and Romney invite a debate about Medicare -- which Democrats have tried to use against Ryan because of his own controversial plan.</p> <p>But Ryan repeated the argument that the federal health care overhaul is the real danger for Medicare seniors because of the cuts it makes.</p> <p>“The greatest threat to Medicare is ObamaCare, and we’re going to stop it,” he said. “So our opponents can consider themselves on notice. In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the left isn’t going to work.”</p> <p>Ryan brought the crowd to its feet when he took the stage and again when he left it.</p> <p>""After four years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround,"" Ryan said at the top, ""and the man for the job is Gov. Mitt Romney.""</p> <p>Ryan’s speech sets the stage for Mitt Romney’s nomination acceptance speech Thursday, which will close out the party’s convention and be the GOP’s last word before Democrats convene in Charlotte, N.C., for their nomination gala.</p> <p>New Jersey Gov.

He said his agents need to review those messages to see whether they contain classified information and whether they affect his previous decision.</p> <p>In July, Mr. Comey announced that while he determined Mrs. Clinton did mishandle classified information, she was too inept to know the risks she was running, so he couldn’t prove she did it intentionally — undercutting a criminal case.</p> <p>His new announcement Friday threatened to upend the presidential campaign.</p> <p>John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, demanded Mr. Comey explain what new information he’s found, and blamed Republicans for “browbeating” the FBI into Friday’s decision.</p> <p>“Director Comey’s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant,” he said.</p> <p>SEE ALSO: The FBI’s sideways handling of Hillary</p> <p>“It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.”</p> <p>Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, said Mr. Comey owes the campaign and the public a “clearer accounting” of the new information.</p> <p>“When you do this 11 days before a presidential election, and you don’t provide many details — but details apparently are being given by the FBI to the press — this is very, very troubling,” Mr. Kaine told VICE News. “We hope that the director, and we really think that he should, give a clearer accounting of exactly what’s going on right now.”</p> <p>Mr. Podesta predicted the FBI would come to the same conclusion this time as it did in July, and he pointedly noted that the letter was sent to eight Republican committee chairman in Congress. But it was also carbon-copied to the ranking Democrats.</p> <p>Mr. Comey did not explain in his letter to what information the new emails contain, how long it will take to evaluate them, nor how they were obtained.</p> <p>The New York Times reported Friday that the emails were snagged as part of an investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, and allegations he sent illicit messages through text and social media applications to a 15-year-old North Carolina girl. The paper reported that law enforcement officials seized at least one device shared by Mr. Weiner and his now estranged wife, Huma Abedin — a top personal aide to Mrs. Clinton. The couple announced they were separating in August amid Mr. Weiner’s involvement in another sexting scandal, but before the 15-year-old girl’s allegations surfaced.</p> <p>As Mrs. Clinton’s top personal aide, Ms. Abedin also had an account on the secret Clinton email server and exchanged classified information with her boss.</p> <p>Mr. Comey said he was briefed on the new emails on Thursday and felt it was important to promptly alert Congress of investigators’ latest efforts.</p> <p>Republican leaders who were among the eight recipients of the letter called for further disclosures by the FBI director, with Sen. Richard C. Shelby urging him to provide additional information before voters go to the polls Nov. 8.</p> <p>“While I am pleased that the FBI is re-opening this case in light of new information, it is imperative that the Bureau immediately evaluate the material to complete this investigation,” said Mr. Shelby, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. “The American people are electing their next Commander-in-Chief only days from now, and they deserve to know the conclusion of your review prior to Election Day.”</p> <p>Sen. Charles E. Grassley, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee was one of the letter’s recipients, said Mr. Comey owes the country more of an explanation about what he’s found.</p> <p>“The letter from Director Comey was unsolicited and, quite honestly, surprising. But it’s left a lot more questions than answers for both the FBI and Secretary Clinton,” the Iowa Republican said.</p> <p>GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, campaigning in Manchester, New Hampshire, said he respected the FBI for reversing itself.</p> <p>“Perhaps, finally, justice will be done,” he said.</p> <p>For her part Mrs. Clinton, campaigning in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, did not address the issue, instead sticking doggedly to her stump speech of attacks on Mr. Trump mixed with a plea to voters to focus on issues.</p> <p>President Obama, who has been saddled by association with Mrs. Clinton, who was serving him during the time she maintained her secret email server, did not respond to questions shouted by reporters Friday afternoon as he left the White House on a campaign trip to Florida to stump for Mrs. Clinton and Democratic Senate candidate Patrick Murphy.</p> <p>Briefing reporters on Air Force One, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said Mr. Obama President Obama expects the FBI to “follow the facts wherever they lead” and to act “irrespective of politics.”</p> <p>Mr. Schultz said the new email development does not affect Mr. Obama’s support of Mrs. Clinton.</p> <p>Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson said on CNN, “Obviously the FBI didn’t do this lightly. There has to be something there.”</p> <p>He lamented the prospect of “a president-elect under criminal investigation.”</p> <p>“That’s what’s going to now be the case, if she is elected,” he said. “She will control those jobs [in the Justice Department] that controls how this issue moves forward, which points to a special prosecutor. This is a mess. It’s a mess. I think Trump is toast, so Hillary moving forward as president-elect? Four years of this? Ugh.”</p> <p>Congressional Republicans, who have been at odds with Mr. Trump on many issues, found common ground with their nominee in attacking Mrs. Clinton.</p> <p>“This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.</p> <p>He again called for the Obama administration to suspend the classified intelligence briefings Mrs. Clinton is getting as the Democratic nominee.</p> <p>And Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, wondered whether the Justice Department will now convene a grand jury to pursue the case.</p> <p>He said the FBI had already cleared Mrs. Clinton of mishandling classified information, so to reopen the case suggests either potential new evidence of intent to mishandle secrets, or other potential criminal questions.</p> <p>“Originally FBI focused on ‘classification rules’ and not broader issues related to government records/obstruction of justice. Will they now?” Mr. Cornyn tweeted.</p> <p>An FBI spokesman declined Friday to comment on the reopening of the investigation.</p> <p>The revelation that the investigation is continuing comes too late to affect the 16 million voters who have already cast ballots in absentee or in-person voting.</p> <p>Republicans have said Mrs. Clinton appeared to mislead Congress in her sworn testimony to the Benghazi probe in 2015.</p> <p>The staggering reversal by Mr. Comey comes as Mrs. Clinton is reeling from another electronic scandal — the revelations from emails obtained and posted by WikiLeaks from Mr. Podesta’s personal email address.</p> <p>Mrs. Clinton refused to use an official state.gov email account during her four years as secretary, instead setting up an account on a server she kept at her home in New York. That arrangement shielded her emails from public disclosure for six years, thwarting open-records laws.</p> <p>She belatedly turned over some 30,000 messages she deemed government-related, but the FBI recovered thousands of others she didn’t — including some that contained classified information.</p>","On Friday, the FBI announced that it has now reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server after discoveries it made from its investigation of Congressman Anthony Weiner's activities.","His new announcement Friday threatened to upend the presidential campaign.<marker>It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.<marker>Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Sen.

He said his agents need to review those messages to see whether they contain classified information and whether they affect his previous decision.</p> <p>In July, Mr. Comey announced that while he determined Mrs. Clinton did mishandle classified information, she was too inept to know the risks she was running, so he couldn’t prove she did it intentionally — undercutting a criminal case.</p> <p>His new announcement Friday threatened to upend the presidential campaign.</p> <p>John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, demanded Mr. Comey explain what new information he’s found, and blamed Republicans for “browbeating” the FBI into Friday’s decision.</p> <p>“Director Comey’s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant,” he said.</p> <p>SEE ALSO: The FBI’s sideways handling of Hillary</p> <p>“It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.”</p> <p>Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, said Mr. Comey owes the campaign and the public a “clearer accounting” of the new information.</p> <p>“When you do this 11 days before a presidential election, and you don’t provide many details — but details apparently are being given by the FBI to the press — this is very, very troubling,” Mr. Kaine told VICE News. “We hope that the director, and we really think that he should, give a clearer accounting of exactly what’s going on right now.”</p> <p>Mr. Podesta predicted the FBI would come to the same conclusion this time as it did in July, and he pointedly noted that the letter was sent to eight Republican committee chairman in Congress. But it was also carbon-copied to the ranking Democrats.</p> <p>Mr. Comey did not explain in his letter to what information the new emails contain, how long it will take to evaluate them, nor how they were obtained.</p> <p>The New York Times reported Friday that the emails were snagged as part of an investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, and allegations he sent illicit messages through text and social media applications to a 15-year-old North Carolina girl. The paper reported that law enforcement officials seized at least one device shared by Mr. Weiner and his now estranged wife, Huma Abedin — a top personal aide to Mrs. Clinton. The couple announced they were separating in August amid Mr. Weiner’s involvement in another sexting scandal, but before the 15-year-old girl’s allegations surfaced.</p> <p>As Mrs. Clinton’s top personal aide, Ms. Abedin also had an account on the secret Clinton email server and exchanged classified information with her boss.</p> <p>Mr. Comey said he was briefed on the new emails on Thursday and felt it was important to promptly alert Congress of investigators’ latest efforts.</p> <p>Republican leaders who were among the eight recipients of the letter called for further disclosures by the FBI director, with Sen. Richard C. Shelby urging him to provide additional information before voters go to the polls Nov. 8.</p> <p>“While I am pleased that the FBI is re-opening this case in light of new information, it is imperative that the Bureau immediately evaluate the material to complete this investigation,” said Mr. Shelby, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. “The American people are electing their next Commander-in-Chief only days from now, and they deserve to know the conclusion of your review prior to Election Day.”</p> <p>Sen. Charles E. Grassley, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee was one of the letter’s recipients, said Mr. Comey owes the country more of an explanation about what he’s found.</p> <p>“The letter from Director Comey was unsolicited and, quite honestly, surprising. But it’s left a lot more questions than answers for both the FBI and Secretary Clinton,” the Iowa Republican said.</p> <p>GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, campaigning in Manchester, New Hampshire, said he respected the FBI for reversing itself.</p> <p>“Perhaps, finally, justice will be done,” he said.</p> <p>For her part Mrs. Clinton, campaigning in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, did not address the issue, instead sticking doggedly to her stump speech of attacks on Mr. Trump mixed with a plea to voters to focus on issues.</p> <p>President Obama, who has been saddled by association with Mrs. Clinton, who was serving him during the time she maintained her secret email server, did not respond to questions shouted by reporters Friday afternoon as he left the White House on a campaign trip to Florida to stump for Mrs. Clinton and Democratic Senate candidate Patrick Murphy.</p> <p>Briefing reporters on Air Force One, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said Mr. Obama President Obama expects the FBI to “follow the facts wherever they lead” and to act “irrespective of politics.”</p> <p>Mr. Schultz said the new email development does not affect Mr. Obama’s support of Mrs. Clinton.</p> <p>Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson said on CNN, “Obviously the FBI didn’t do this lightly. There has to be something there.”</p> <p>He lamented the prospect of “a president-elect under criminal investigation.”</p> <p>“That’s what’s going to now be the case, if she is elected,” he said. “She will control those jobs [in the Justice Department] that controls how this issue moves forward, which points to a special prosecutor. This is a mess. It’s a mess. I think Trump is toast, so Hillary moving forward as president-elect? Four years of this? Ugh.”</p> <p>Congressional Republicans, who have been at odds with Mr. Trump on many issues, found common ground with their nominee in attacking Mrs. Clinton.</p> <p>“This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.</p> <p>He again called for the Obama administration to suspend the classified intelligence briefings Mrs. Clinton is getting as the Democratic nominee.</p> <p>And Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, wondered whether the Justice Department will now convene a grand jury to pursue the case.</p> <p>He said the FBI had already cleared Mrs. Clinton of mishandling classified information, so to reopen the case suggests either potential new evidence of intent to mishandle secrets, or other potential criminal questions.</p> <p>“Originally FBI focused on ‘classification rules’ and not broader issues related to government records/obstruction of justice. Will they now?” Mr. Cornyn tweeted.</p> <p>An FBI spokesman declined Friday to comment on the reopening of the investigation.</p> <p>The revelation that the investigation is continuing comes too late to affect the 16 million voters who have already cast ballots in absentee or in-person voting.</p> <p>Republicans have said Mrs. Clinton appeared to mislead Congress in her sworn testimony to the Benghazi probe in 2015.</p> <p>The staggering reversal by Mr. Comey comes as Mrs. Clinton is reeling from another electronic scandal — the revelations from emails obtained and posted by WikiLeaks from Mr. Podesta’s personal email address.</p> <p>Mrs. Clinton refused to use an official state.gov email account during her four years as secretary, instead setting up an account on a server she kept at her home in New York. That arrangement shielded her emails from public disclosure for six years, thwarting open-records laws.</p> <p>She belatedly turned over some 30,000 messages she deemed government-related, but the FBI recovered thousands of others she didn’t — including some that contained classified information.</p>","On Friday, the FBI announced that it has now reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server after discoveries it made from its investigation of Congressman Anthony Weiner's activities.",{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,Right,Right,Correct,36b2a365-18da-47ec-80ca-0925a7b38257,,,,,,,,

Are we going to demand trust and transparency from our leaders? Have we had enough of a ruling political class that doles out favors to the wealthy and well connected few?”</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has tried to tamp down the controversy since it emerged this week in previews of the book “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.”</p> <p>The book, by conservative political adviser Peter Schweizer, argues that the Clintons got rich from speaking fees and donations in return for favors from Mrs. Clinton to various foreign interests while running the State Department.</p> <p>Other dealings include a free trade agreement in Colombia that benefited a major foundation donor’s investments in the South American nation, development projects in Haiti after a devastating earthquake in 2010, and more than $1 million in payments to Mr. Clinton by a Canadian bank and major shareholder in the Keystone XL oil pipeline that occurred while the project was under State Department review, according to reports.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign tried to dismiss the accusations as a right-wing “smear project,” but that becomes increasingly difficult as mainstream news outlets pick up the story.</p> <p>Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon sent a memo Thursday to supporters and donors in an attempt to beat back the accusations.</p> <p>“The bottom line remains that the book fails to produce a shred of evidence supporting the theory that Hillary Clinton ever took action as Secretary of State for the purposes of supporting the interests of donors to the Clinton foundation,” he wrote.</p> <p>At a campaign stop in New Hampshire this week, Mrs. Clinton brushed aside reporters’ questions about connections between contributions from foreign entities and her actions as secretary of state, calling them merely “distractions and attacks.”</p> <p>“I know that that comes, unfortunately, with the territory,” she told The Associated Press.</p>",Hillary and the Russian Uranium Deal,struggled <marker><marker>fend off a barrage of questions<marker>nearly corner<marker>wrestled<marker> quell the uproar.<marker>,{},0,5,0|5|4,2.5,Right,Right,Right,Correct,3913bcbd-3809-46c4-9d64-0b114c9ba23e,,,,,,,,

Let’s review: Ryan helps to create a massive structural deficit, repeatedly and almost single-handedly prevents a solution, then runs for vice-president, blaming Obama for the structural deficit and further blaming him for his unwillingness to agree that this is all his own fault.

Ryan and his fellow Republicans have made various gestures toward the notion of some kind of plan of their own to provide access to health insurance for people who can’t afford it, but they have never been willing to devote the necessary resources. Here was Ryan actually assailing not the method but the goal, implicitly conceding his position that health insurance is not an entitlement but a nice thing everybody would like but not everybody can have, like a beach house.</p> <p>The political logic embedded in Ryan’s formulation was even more telling. He dismissed the goal of providing health insurance to those who can’t afford it as something “we didn’t even ask for.” Who is “we”? We is the majority of Americans who do have health insurance. We outnumber the 50 million who don’t. They can go screw themselves. Ryan actually called Obama’s decision to cut what he deemed wasteful spending in Medicare to cover the uninsured his “coldest power play.” It is a cold power play to give medical care to people who can’t get it, and an act of compassion to take it away from them.</p> <p>The political blogosphere has taken apart Ryan’s brazen dishonesty brick by brick so that barely anything remains. I have been writing about his dishonesty for three years. I have the equivalent of a master’s degree in Ryan lie-ology. I’ve heard many of his lurid fantasies innumerable times and I haven’t got it in me to go through it all again — his deep dishonesty largely reflects the fundamental gap between the radicalism of his agenda and his need for public acceptance. I’ll merely point out that, even if all the smaller component dishonesties of Ryan’s speech were true, the larger points they undergirded were false as well.</p> <p>Ryan began by castigating Obama for borrowing money to fund a stimulus. He then castigated Obama for making his “first order of business” the passage of health-care reform rather than economic rescue, when Ryan himself had just told the audience that the first thing Obama had done was actually to pass a plan intended to rescue the economy. Having argued that Obama erred by distracting himself with health care rather than devote all his energies to the recovery, Ryan immediately promised he and Romney would repeal Obamacare — wouldn’t that also possibly distract from their own economic focus?</p> <p>In the same vein, Ryan told unemployed Americans, “if you’re feeling passed by, you have not failed, your leaders have failed you” — and then, moments later, sneered that Obama saw economically struggling Americans as “victims of circumstances beyond our control.” Ryan believes fervently that Obama’s failures are the sole exception to the general rule that individuals are the masters of their own economic fate. To bolster his claim that people move in and out of economic classes constantly without government intervention, Ryan described a few menial short-term jobs he had performed in his early years, boasting, “I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life” — as if, but for his own gumption and elbow grease, the heir to one of the richest families in his town was really at risk of staying in his summer lawn-mowing job forever.</p> <p>At the political level, Ryan’s notion of responsibility beggars belief. Under the Bush administration, Republicans — with Ryan’s support and often active leadership — systematically destroyed the fiscal position of the federal government. They voted for large tax cuts, a new entitlement, wars, and twice repealed pay-as-you-go budget rules that would have required them to pay for all these things. As a result, when Obama took office at the outset of the economic crisis, he inherited an annual deficit of well over a trillion dollars.</p> <p>Obama tried on numerous occasions to craft bipartisan agreements to reduce the long-term debt. Ryan, using the enormous intra-party influence he had amassed, crushed those agreements at every turn. Ryan voted against the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission, killing its prospects. To complete the dishonesty, Ryan referred to the debt commission he served on and helped kill as “they,” not “we.” (Ryan’s defenders sometimes assert that he only voted against the plan because it failed to include privatized Medicare, but in fact Ryan opposed a compromise that would do that, as well.) Ryan killed a bipartisan Senate plan and also killed a negotiated debt settlement between Obama and John Boehner.</p> <p>Part of Ryan’s logic at the time (according to two sources, one in each party) was that signing a deal “would pave the way for Mr. Obama’s easy reelection.” This was a plausible calculation — agreeing to a deficit compromise would have made it hard for Republicans to run against Obama as a left-wing spendthrift. And here was Ryan last night, running against Obama as a left-wing spendthrift, precisely as his own strategy enabled.</p> <p>Incredibly, the larger theme of Ryan’s speech was to assail Obama for failing to take full responsibilities for this state of affairs — Obama is “shifting blame,” “blaming others.” It is the single largest motif of Ryan’s speech. Let’s review: Ryan helps to create a massive structural deficit, repeatedly and almost single-handedly prevents a solution, then runs for vice-president, blaming Obama for the structural deficit and further blaming him for his unwillingness to agree that this is all his own fault. The really amazing thing is that it could possibly work.</p>",Ryan RNC Speech,"Amidst the vast plumes of rhetorical homages to freedom and entrepreneurship and the evils of central planning, there was but one small moment in Paul Ryan’s speech when he actually spelled out what his abstract rhetorical formulations really mean.

That’s the incendiary claim made against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a forthcoming book and laid out in today’s NYT The author’s allegation, which will air on television for the first time today at 10 am ET on the Fox News Channel, is that Clinton personally benefitted from a deal that would eventually make the United States dependent on Vladimir Putin’s Russia for its supply of uranium</p> <p>[Jeb’s next - Peter Schweizer, the author of the forthcoming “Clinton Cash” book tells Bloomberg that his next target is GOP frontrunner Jeb Bush Schweizer said he and his team have already found “some interesting things”]</p> <p>What will they say? - The Times, which like Fox News and the Washington Post, was given advance access to the book and its supporting documentation in order to verify its claims, drops its first story today T are more bombshells to come, some of which will be revealed in “Special Report with ” tonight at 6 pm ET, but this opening salvo is devastating Baier, who has been working on the project for weeks, described the importance of this chapter: “While all of these deals and the money that flowed to the Clintons is complicated, now the nascent Clinton campaign will have to respond with more than just ‘you can't prove it’ And hovering over all of this is a destroyed email server that many lawmakers now believe may have held the keys to unlock the behind-the-scenes connections between the Clinton Foundation, the family’s personal fortune and the secretary of state”</p> <p>[WaPo: “Bill Clinton was paid more than $100 million for speeches between 2001 and 2013, according to federal financial disclosure forms filed by Hillary Clinton during her years as a senator and as secretary of state”]</p> <p>Moscow duck - The first installment is about how Canadian mogul Frank Giustra brought the former President Clinton in 2005 to help score a huge uranium deal with the repressive government of Kazakhstan Giustra would go on to donate $313 million to the Clintons’ foundation several months after the Kazakhstan deal But the company’s stock began to crater after charges of illegal dealings A Russian interest was willing to shore up the company, but wanted an ownership share, a deal that got the approval of the Clinton State Department When Putin’s government went for a controlling interest, a move that meant a huge windfall for investors, a cabinet committee on which Hillary Clinton sits, signed off on the deal Around the same time, Bill Clinton also receives $500,000 for a speech in Moscow from a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin</p> <p>[General Electric’s CEO, a major Clinton backer, told shareholders that the company would not release emails related to obtaining help from the Clinton State Department in landing a $19 billion power plant deal in Algeria]</p> <p>Does it matter? - The Clinton campaign is dismissive of the claims, saying that such connections don’t amount to a conspiracy But in light of the more than 30,000 emails that Clinton destroyed from her time as secretary of state, their case for multiple beneficial coincidences is hard to prop up And the stakes  are sky-high Here’s how the NYT put it: “‘Should we be concerned? Absolutely,’ said Michael McFaul, who served under Mrs Clinton as the American ambassador to Russia but said he had been unaware of the Uranium One deal until asked about it ‘Do we want Putin to have a monopoly on this? Of course we don’t We don’t want to be dependent on Putin for anything in this climate’”</p> <p>[Liberal Democrats in the Senate scored a small victory against President Obama’s bid on free trade legislation The fight will continue as the legislation advances]</p> <p>Never mind… - Which Senator said the following in an indignant 2004 floor speech touting their opposition to gay marriage? “[Marriage is] the fundamental bedrock principle that exists between a man and a woman, going back into the mists of history as one of the founding, foundational institutions of history and humanity and civilization, and that its primary, principal role during those millennia has been the raising and socializing of children for the society into which they are to become adults” Was that Sen Rick Santorum, R-Pa?

That starts to sound like something that can cross the line between unseemly and potentially illegal But what if those favors compromised national security? That’s the incendiary claim made against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a forthcoming book and laid out in today’s NYT The author’s allegation, which will air on television for the first time today at 10 am ET on the Fox News Channel, is that Clinton personally benefitted from a deal that would eventually make the United States dependent on Vladimir Putin’s Russia for its supply of uranium</p> <p>[Jeb’s next - Peter Schweizer, the author of the forthcoming “Clinton Cash” book tells Bloomberg that his next target is GOP frontrunner Jeb Bush Schweizer said he and his team have already found “some interesting things”]</p> <p>What will they say? - The Times, which like Fox News and the Washington Post, was given advance access to the book and its supporting documentation in order to verify its claims, drops its first story today T are more bombshells to come, some of which will be revealed in “Special Report with ” tonight at 6 pm ET, but this opening salvo is devastating Baier, who has been working on the project for weeks, described the importance of this chapter: “While all of these deals and the money that flowed to the Clintons is complicated, now the nascent Clinton campaign will have to respond with more than just ‘you can't prove it’ And hovering over all of this is a destroyed email server that many lawmakers now believe may have held the keys to unlock the behind-the-scenes connections between the Clinton Foundation, the family’s personal fortune and the secretary of state”</p> <p>[WaPo: “Bill Clinton was paid more than $100 million for speeches between 2001 and 2013, according to federal financial disclosure forms filed by Hillary Clinton during her years as a senator and as secretary of state”]</p> <p>Moscow duck - The first installment is about how Canadian mogul Frank Giustra brought the former President Clinton in 2005 to help score a huge uranium deal with the repressive government of Kazakhstan Giustra would go on to donate $313 million to the Clintons’ foundation several months after the Kazakhstan deal But the company’s stock began to crater after charges of illegal dealings A Russian interest was willing to shore up the company, but wanted an ownership share, a deal that got the approval of the Clinton State Department When Putin’s government went for a controlling interest, a move that meant a huge windfall for investors, a cabinet committee on which Hillary Clinton sits, signed off on the deal Around the same time, Bill Clinton also receives $500,000 for a speech in Moscow from a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin</p> <p>[General Electric’s CEO, a major Clinton backer, told shareholders that the company would not release emails related to obtaining help from the Clinton State Department in landing a $19 billion power plant deal in Algeria]</p> <p>Does it matter? - The Clinton campaign is dismissive of the claims, saying that such connections don’t amount to a conspiracy But in light of the more than 30,000 emails that Clinton destroyed from her time as secretary of state, their case for multiple beneficial coincidences is hard to prop up And the stakes  are sky-high Here’s how the NYT put it: “‘Should we be concerned? Absolutely,’ said Michael McFaul, who served under Mrs Clinton as the American ambassador to Russia but said he had been unaware of the Uranium One deal until asked about it ‘Do we want Putin to have a monopoly on this? Of course we don’t We don’t want to be dependent on Putin for anything in this climate’”</p> <p>[Liberal Democrats in the Senate scored a small victory against President Obama’s bid on free trade legislation The fight will continue as the legislation advances]</p> <p>Never mind… - Which Senator said the following in an indignant 2004 floor speech touting their opposition to gay marriage? “[Marriage is] the fundamental bedrock principle that exists between a man and a woman, going back into the mists of history as one of the founding, foundational institutions of history and humanity and civilization, and that its primary, principal role during those millennia has been the raising and socializing of children for the society into which they are to become adults” Was that Sen Rick Santorum, R-Pa?

Congress will have to act again at that point, and you should completely ignore any estimate, from any source, going beyond that year. I will observe that rule here.</p> <p>The first thing to bear in mind is that their estimates are (naturally) based on previous work by the CBO, which rightly or wrongly believes the individual mandate to be quite effective. As many conservatives have pointed out, much of the CBO’s coverage losses thus can be characterized as people voluntarily going uninsured when they’re no longer required to. In fairness, though, there’s a follow-on effect as well: As healthy people opt out of insurance, premiums go up, causing more to opt out.</p> <p>The second thing to bear in mind is that since the whole point of Graham-Cassidy is to give states leeway to use (most of) Obamacare’s funding to set up their own health-care solutions, Fiedler and Adler have to guess as to what the states will do. Their solution is to divide states into four tiers that take approaches of varying generosity.</p> <p>Here they make a point that I think some conservatives will appreciate: Since money is fungible and the block grants have few strings attached, states can in effect use the cash to fund projects that have nothing to do with health care. This is how:</p> <p>All states would need to do is identify existing state health care programs that qualify for block grant funding, thereby freeing up the state dollars currently devoted to those program to be used in whatever way the state wishes. If this were a state’s goal, the legislation makes it easy to achieve. Total block grant funding under the Graham-Cassidy proposal is $200 billion in 2026. States could almost certainly use block grant funds to support programs that provide substance abuse and mental health services; non-Medicaid state and local government spending on such services is likely to be on the order of $50 billion in 2026. As another example, states could likely use block grant funding to finance health benefits for state and local employees; state costs in this area are likely to be on the order of $200 billion in 2026. Thus, these expenditures alone are more than sufficient to absorb the block grant funding that the Graham-Cassidy legislation would make available in 2026. States would likely identify many other categories of existing programs that could be funded with block grant dollars, such as programs that compensate medical providers for uncompensated care or spending on health care for prison inmates. In other instances, states might be able to direct money into their general funds by funneling them through public hospitals. While it is likely that some of these uses are not intended by the legislation’s authors, many of them may be difficult to disallow while still providing states with the broad discretion over the use of the block grant funds that the authors clearly do intend.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>On one hand, this just means Graham-Cassidy will be even more “federalist.” After all, it translates to more freedom for states to put the money to the use they think best — it allows them to decide the level of health-care spending in the state, not just the system through which the money will be spent. But on the other, conservatives are not fans of the federal government doling out cash to state governments for no particular reason. (An interesting possibility that occurred to me: Could liberal states play this shell game as well, and use the diverted money to, say, provide plans that cover abortion?)</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Fielder and Adler’s division of states seems at least defensible, however much guesswork it entails. States that declined to expand Medicaid, even though the federal government promised to pick up the overwhelming bulk of the tab, would be inclined to divert their money; blue states would be more inclined to continue Obamacare’s policies. The authors caution that their estimates do not account for the turmoil states will experience as they set up their own marketplaces, or for the bill’s cap on traditional Medicaid spending.</p> <p>Like I said: highly speculative, but worth digging into.</p>","Senator John McCain announced today that he would vote no on the latest Obamacare repeal bill, also known as the Graham-Cassidy proposal. Many publications have noted that this likely means the bill is dead and will not move forward. McCain said in a statement that he, ""cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,"" as it had not gone through a bipartisan, rigorous debate process.",{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,,,,41428d3c-58d5-409a-b2ca-f4f47195540e,,Right,MATCH,,OK,,,X

As many conservatives have pointed out, much of the CBO’s coverage losses thus can be characterized as people voluntarily going uninsured when they’re no longer required to. In fairness, though, there’s a follow-on effect as well: As healthy people opt out of insurance, premiums go up, causing more to opt out.</p> <p>The second thing to bear in mind is that since the whole point of Graham-Cassidy is to give states leeway to use (most of) Obamacare’s funding to set up their own health-care solutions, Fiedler and Adler have to guess as to what the states will do. Their solution is to divide states into four tiers that take approaches of varying generosity.</p> <p>Here they make a point that I think some conservatives will appreciate: Since money is fungible and the block grants have few strings attached, states can in effect use the cash to fund projects that have nothing to do with health care. This is how:</p> <p>All states would need to do is identify existing state health care programs that qualify for block grant funding, thereby freeing up the state dollars currently devoted to those program to be used in whatever way the state wishes. If this were a state’s goal, the legislation makes it easy to achieve. Total block grant funding under the Graham-Cassidy proposal is $200 billion in 2026. States could almost certainly use block grant funds to support programs that provide substance abuse and mental health services; non-Medicaid state and local government spending on such services is likely to be on the order of $50 billion in 2026. As another example, states could likely use block grant funding to finance health benefits for state and local employees; state costs in this area are likely to be on the order of $200 billion in 2026. Thus, these expenditures alone are more than sufficient to absorb the block grant funding that the Graham-Cassidy legislation would make available in 2026. States would likely identify many other categories of existing programs that could be funded with block grant dollars, such as programs that compensate medical providers for uncompensated care or spending on health care for prison inmates. In other instances, states might be able to direct money into their general funds by funneling them through public hospitals. While it is likely that some of these uses are not intended by the legislation’s authors, many of them may be difficult to disallow while still providing states with the broad discretion over the use of the block grant funds that the authors clearly do intend.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>On one hand, this just means Graham-Cassidy will be even more “federalist.” After all, it translates to more freedom for states to put the money to the use they think best — it allows them to decide the level of health-care spending in the state, not just the system through which the money will be spent. But on the other, conservatives are not fans of the federal government doling out cash to state governments for no particular reason. (An interesting possibility that occurred to me: Could liberal states play this shell game as well, and use the diverted money to, say, provide plans that cover abortion?)</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Fielder and Adler’s division of states seems at least defensible, however much guesswork it entails. States that declined to expand Medicaid, even though the federal government promised to pick up the overwhelming bulk of the tab, would be inclined to divert their money; blue states would be more inclined to continue Obamacare’s policies. The authors caution that their estimates do not account for the turmoil states will experience as they set up their own marketplaces, or for the bill’s cap on traditional Medicaid spending.</p> <p>Like I said: highly speculative, but worth digging into.</p>","Senator John McCain announced today that he would vote no on the latest Obamacare repeal bill, also known as the Graham-Cassidy proposal. Many publications have noted that this likely means the bill is dead and will not move forward. McCain said in a statement that he, ""cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,"" as it had not gone through a bipartisan, rigorous debate process.",{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,Center,Right,NotByCenter,41428d3c-58d5-409a-b2ca-f4f47195540e,,,,,,,,

The speech is likely to have lasting impact in this campaign.</p> <p>Which perhaps explains the panicky reaction of the mainstream press and Ryan’s liberal critics. Almost from the moment Ryan finished his speech, apologists for the president (including the Washington Post) have come out swinging, quite plainly indignant that Ryan landed so many punches when the usual media filters couldn’t stop him.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#ad#And, so, not surprisingly, these same apologists have resorted to the usual kind of smear tactics — accusing Ryan of offering up misleading arguments and even “lies.”</p> <p>These criticisms of Ryan’s speech are absurd. Everything Ryan said is factual and a fair reading of the record and prior events.</p> <p>Let’s start with Medicare. Ryan’s critics are beside themselves that the Romney campaign has effectively pinned $716 billion in Medicare cuts on the Obama administration. Two arguments are made to defend the president. First, it is said that Ryan’s own budget cut Medicare by the same amount. But the Ryan budget not only repealed all of Obamacare’s spending, it also doesn’t specify the kinds of Medicare cuts Obamacare does: It calls for the same level of savings but doesn’t spend the money elsewhere and leaves room for Congress to pursue those savings in ways that don’t rely on price controls and the elimination of benefits. Moreover, both Romney and Ryan have said that they, in a Romney administration, would meet their budgetary goals without Obamacare’s Medicare cuts by trimming elsewhere in the budget. And it is certainly the case that Romney and Ryan will have much greater flexibility than Ryan did as House Budget Committee chairman to make cuts wherever they can find them.</p> <p>Ryan’s critics also take exception to the implication that the Medicare “cuts” will do any harm to the health care provided to seniors, arguing that the savings come from “targeted cuts to providers,” not seniors. This is utter nonsense. Among the cuts in Obamacare is a deep and permanent reduction in payments to Medicare Advantage plans. According to the Medicare trustees, that cut will force 4 million seniors out of their Medicare Advantage plans. There is no question that these seniors will lose thousands of dollars per year in health benefits because of these cuts. Moreover, the chief actuary for the Medicare program has projected that, by the end of this decade, 15 percent of facilities will have to stop taking Medicare patients because of Obamacare’s cuts. That will directly impair access to care for millions of seniors, and the percentage of hospitals and nursing homes dropping out of Medicare will grow to 25 percent by 2030.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Ryan’s critics are also up in arms over his mention of the closed GM plant in Janesville, Wis. They claim that Ryan blamed President Obama for the closing of the plant — but Ryan explicitly said that the plant was already closing when then-candidate Obama came to Janesville in 2008: “We were about to lose a major factory,” Ryan said last night. Second, it is worth recalling that Obama, in a June 2008 statement, said that, if elected president, he would “lead an effort to retool plants like the GM facility in Janesville.” This is further confirmation of Ryan’s point that Obama essentially promised to find a way to keep the plant open after he became president — and did not deliver.</p> <p>But let’s step back and look at Ryan’s larger point. He was making the argument that, even with the Obama bailout, the Obama economy is so bad that the plant is still closed and, what’s worse, there’s no prospect that other vibrant industries will take its place. That’s absolutely a fair indictment of the Obama record, especially so because Obama went to the plant and promised hope and change in 2008.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#page#Then there is the business of the U.S. credit downgrade and the Bowles-Simpson commission. In his speech, Ryan properly excoriated the president for his profligate spending and for his indifference to the nation’s debt crisis. During the president’s term, the national debt will rise by more than $5 trillion. Ryan pinned S&P’s decision to lower the credit rating for debt issued by the U.S. government on the president’s failure to lead on fiscal matters, and chastised him specifically for appointing the Bowles-Simpson commission and then doing nothing with the commission’s recommendations. Ryan’s critics say he is being hypocritical because Ryan himself also opposed the Bowles-Simpson recommendations.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>But when Ryan opposed that plan (because it left in place Obamacare’s massive new entitlement spending), he proposed an alternative and passed it through the House of Representatives. What did President Obama do? Nothing. He appointed the commission to buy time during the 2010 campaign season, and then, in 2011, decided that leading on the deficit wasn’t in his political interest. So he proposed no plan of his own. And then when Ryan proposed his plan to actually head off a fiscal crisis, the president attacked it in the most partisan and demagogic terms possible. Is it any surprise, with this kind of behavior from the president, that the parties weren’t able to come to an amicable agreement? Any fair reading of the record shows that the president has abdicated his leadership responsibilities on fiscal matters. He richly deserves the blame for the downgrade.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#ad#Finally, Ryan’s critics cannot stomach the fact that Ryan refuses to play along with their caricatures of him as an uncaring Randian, obsessed with individualism and indifferent to the needs of the vulnerable. In his speech, Ryan specifically noted that a society should be measured by how well the strong protect the weak. That’s entirely consistent with the budget plan he favors. As usual, his critics want the world to equate more governmental programs and spending with improvement in the lives of the poor. And yet, after trillions in spending, poverty and dependence are on the rise under President Obama.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Under Romney and Ryan, there will be plenty of room for generous government spending on a safety net for those who are truly incapable of taking care of themselves. That’s as it should be. But what the poor really need is opportunity, for better-paying jobs and mobility up the wage scale. There is a mountain of evidence that what will help the poor more than anything else is a vibrant free-market economy. Moreover, the reason welfare reform was such a success in 1996 was not that it limited government spending (although it did do that) but that it improved the lives of millions of lower-income American families by emphasizing work over dependence. That’s a lesson that Ryan’s critics, the president included, still have not learned.</p> <p>Paul Ryan’s acceptance speech was a tour de force, and a clear success. One measure of that success is the intensity and emptiness of the attacks coming his way. The irony is that these attacks — intended to damage Ryan by undermining his credibility — are more likely to be seen by the electorate for what they really are: desperate and dishonest tactics from those willing to say and do anything to hang on to power.</p> <p>— James C.

He was making the argument that, even with the Obama bailout, the Obama economy is so bad that the plant is still closed and, what’s worse, there’s no prospect that other vibrant industries will take its place. That’s absolutely a fair indictment of the Obama record, especially so because Obama went to the plant and promised hope and change in 2008.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#page#Then there is the business of the U.S. credit downgrade and the Bowles-Simpson commission. In his speech, Ryan properly excoriated the president for his profligate spending and for his indifference to the nation’s debt crisis. During the president’s term, the national debt will rise by more than $5 trillion. Ryan pinned S&P’s decision to lower the credit rating for debt issued by the U.S. government on the president’s failure to lead on fiscal matters, and chastised him specifically for appointing the Bowles-Simpson commission and then doing nothing with the commission’s recommendations. Ryan’s critics say he is being hypocritical because Ryan himself also opposed the Bowles-Simpson recommendations.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>But when Ryan opposed that plan (because it left in place Obamacare’s massive new entitlement spending), he proposed an alternative and passed it through the House of Representatives. What did President Obama do? Nothing. He appointed the commission to buy time during the 2010 campaign season, and then, in 2011, decided that leading on the deficit wasn’t in his political interest. So he proposed no plan of his own. And then when Ryan proposed his plan to actually head off a fiscal crisis, the president attacked it in the most partisan and demagogic terms possible. Is it any surprise, with this kind of behavior from the president, that the parties weren’t able to come to an amicable agreement? Any fair reading of the record shows that the president has abdicated his leadership responsibilities on fiscal matters. He richly deserves the blame for the downgrade.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#ad#Finally, Ryan’s critics cannot stomach the fact that Ryan refuses to play along with their caricatures of him as an uncaring Randian, obsessed with individualism and indifferent to the needs of the vulnerable. In his speech, Ryan specifically noted that a society should be measured by how well the strong protect the weak. That’s entirely consistent with the budget plan he favors. As usual, his critics want the world to equate more governmental programs and spending with improvement in the lives of the poor. And yet, after trillions in spending, poverty and dependence are on the rise under President Obama.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Under Romney and Ryan, there will be plenty of room for generous government spending on a safety net for those who are truly incapable of taking care of themselves. That’s as it should be. But what the poor really need is opportunity, for better-paying jobs and mobility up the wage scale. There is a mountain of evidence that what will help the poor more than anything else is a vibrant free-market economy. Moreover, the reason welfare reform was such a success in 1996 was not that it limited government spending (although it did do that) but that it improved the lives of millions of lower-income American families by emphasizing work over dependence. That’s a lesson that Ryan’s critics, the president included, still have not learned.</p> <p>Paul Ryan’s acceptance speech was a tour de force, and a clear success. One measure of that success is the intensity and emptiness of the attacks coming his way. The irony is that these attacks — intended to damage Ryan by undermining his credibility — are more likely to be seen by the electorate for what they really are: desperate and dishonest tactics from those willing to say and do anything to hang on to power.</p> <p>— James C.

Secretary DeVos, a Christian grandmother and philanthropist who has spent her career trying to improve the quality of education for poor children, has been criticized and mocked relentlessly. And she is the only Cabinet secretary who travels with a cadre of U. S. Marshals because of death threats she’s received.</p> <p>So why, as “60 Minutes”’ Lesley Stahl put it, has Secretary DeVos become the “most hated Cabinet secretary?”</p> <p>One reason—as opinion pieces in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have argued—is that some of the Democratic party’s most deep-pocketed and powerful interest groups are teachers’ unions who realize that they will no longer have a near-monopoly on education.</p> <p>Another reason, as the New York Times’ Ross Douthat argued, is that the Democratic party’s upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency - who are big supporters, in theory, of public education – bristle at the idea of DeVos’ charters and vouchers being attractive to poor and minority families (who in their view belong in public schools) or families with ideological or religious convictions that differ from their own.</p> <p>On second thought, I guess it’s not so hard to understand why the left’s hard-core education bureaucracy is so opposed to her. She is a serious threat to the status quo that has served them – if not students – so well.</p> <p>Perhaps the most significant reason, however, is the one Secretary DeVos gave in response to Stahl’s question: more than anything else, she is misunderstood.</p> <p>To clear up any misunderstanding caused by the left’s holy war against her, here are four things Americans should understand about Secretary DeVos’ educational vision:</p> <p>First, as she noted in the “60 Minutes” interview, Secretary DeVos wants to liberate American education from encroachment by federal bureaucracy. Under the Obama administration, the federal government functioned as a giant octopus, bypassing families, communities, and states in order to reach its tentacles into school curriculum, teacher evaluation, values conformity, and even restroom policies. Betsy DeVos signals a departure from that era. Her stated educational philosophy suggests that she will not turn Democratic encroachment into Republican encroachment; instead, she will reduce federal encroachment in order to empower families, local communities, and states.</p> <p>Second, Secretary DeVos emphasizes freedom of thought.

Secretary DeVos, a Christian grandmother and philanthropist who has spent her career trying to improve the quality of education for poor children, has been criticized and mocked relentlessly. And she is the only Cabinet secretary who travels with a cadre of U. S. Marshals because of death threats she’s received.</p> <p>So why, as “60 Minutes”’ Lesley Stahl put it, has Secretary DeVos become the “most hated Cabinet secretary?”</p> <p>One reason—as opinion pieces in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have argued—is that some of the Democratic party’s most deep-pocketed and powerful interest groups are teachers’ unions who realize that they will no longer have a near-monopoly on education.</p> <p>Another reason, as the New York Times’ Ross Douthat argued, is that the Democratic party’s upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency - who are big supporters, in theory, of public education – bristle at the idea of DeVos’ charters and vouchers being attractive to poor and minority families (who in their view belong in public schools) or families with ideological or religious convictions that differ from their own.</p> <p>On second thought, I guess it’s not so hard to understand why the left’s hard-core education bureaucracy is so opposed to her. She is a serious threat to the status quo that has served them – if not students – so well.</p> <p>Perhaps the most significant reason, however, is the one Secretary DeVos gave in response to Stahl’s question: more than anything else, she is misunderstood.</p> <p>To clear up any misunderstanding caused by the left’s holy war against her, here are four things Americans should understand about Secretary DeVos’ educational vision:</p> <p>First, as she noted in the “60 Minutes” interview, Secretary DeVos wants to liberate American education from encroachment by federal bureaucracy. Under the Obama administration, the federal government functioned as a giant octopus, bypassing families, communities, and states in order to reach its tentacles into school curriculum, teacher evaluation, values conformity, and even restroom policies. Betsy DeVos signals a departure from that era. Her stated educational philosophy suggests that she will not turn Democratic encroachment into Republican encroachment; instead, she will reduce federal encroachment in order to empower families, local communities, and states.</p> <p>Second, Secretary DeVos emphasizes freedom of thought. During her confirmation hearings, the media made much ado about her “Dutch Calvinist” religious views. But Dutch Calvinism is a rich religious tradition that emphasizes the rights and freedoms of families, communities, and religions. For that reason, it finds adherents on the right and on the left. Additionally, it places an especially high value on education, but emphasizes that a plural society should be tolerant enough to allow diverse families and communities to build their own educational institutions and choose which institution(s) their children can attend. Unfortunately, many liberal educators are quite illiberal, unwilling to tolerate any type of educational diversity that undermines the federal government’s impulse toward command-and-control.</p> <p>Third, she wants to empower financially-disadvantaged families to send their children to whichever school they deem best. Under the current system, the government taxes citizens in order to provide education, but then dictates and determines how the tax money can be used. The message is clear: the federal government—rather than the family or local community—is responsible for shaping the way a child understands and interprets the world.</p> <p>Under Secretary DeVos’ system of vouchers and charters, however, citizens will be able to exercise more influence over their own child’s education. They will also be able to send their children to a wider variety of schools, including those that would have been financially prohibitive without the vouchers.

His key point — one he reiterated in his tweet announcing the decision — is this:</p> <p>We should not be content to pass health care legislation on a party-line basis, as Democrats did when they rammed Obamacare through Congress in 2009. If we do so, our success could be as short-lived as theirs when the political winds shift, as they regularly do. The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance.

The top-ranking congressional Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan, said Thursday he doesn’t see a purpose in recusal unless Sessions is the subject of the investigation.</p> <p>He told reporters he’s seen “no evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, and “Democrats are lighting their hair on fire to get you to cover this story.”</p> <p>A White House official, in a statement, described Democrats’ demands as a “partisan” attack, suggesting the controversy is timed to distract from the positive response to President Trump’s address to Congress earlier this week.</p> <p>“This is the latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats. [Attorney General] Sessions met with the ambassador in an official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is entirely consistent with his testimony,” the official said.</p> <p>In a statement to Fox News, the former Alabama Republican senator said, ""I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.""</p> <p>While Sessions is denying he specifically discussed campaign issues with the Russians, The Washington Post first reported that he did speak twice last year with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. One discussion, in July, was described as involving a group of ambassadors after a Heritage Foundation event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention. Kislyak was part of a “small group” of diplomats who approached Sessions and spoke with him.</p> <p>A subsequent meeting was held in September in the senator’s office. Justice officials said Sessions met with ambassadors in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p> <p>But while Sessions was serving on the Senate Armed Services panel, he also was a prominent surrogate for then-candidate Donald Trump. And in Senate testimony, Sessions denied contacts with the Russians.</p> <p>Asked by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., at that hearing what he’d do with evidence that anyone tied to the campaign communicated with Russia last year, Sessions said: “I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I … did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.”</p> <p>The Post noted that Sessions also responded, “No,” in a written answer when asked whether he’d been in contact with any part of the Russian government regarding the election.</p> <p>Officials told the Post Sessions did not consider his discussions relevant and did not recall details of what was discussed with the ambassador from Russia.</p> <p>White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, speaking with “Fox & Friends’” Abby Huntsman, also said Sessions “did his job” as a senator. He said Sessions was “100 percent straight with the committee” and Democrats are playing politics.</p> <p>“There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,” Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. “Last year, the senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors. He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign -- not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.”</p> <p>According to a schedule provided to Fox News, Sessions had 30 meetings with numerous ambassadors from April 14 through Nov. 11. Russia appears on the schedule only once – the Sept. 8 meeting with Kislyak. The day before, Sessions also took a meeting with Ukraine Ambassador Valeriy Chaly. These meetings took place a week before a seven-day unilateral ceasefire plan was accepted by Russia on behalf of separatist rebels it backed in the conflict with Ukraine.</p> <p>But for Democrats, the revelations of any Russia discussions only served to fuel long-running accusations that Trump-tied officials have sought to conceal past contacts with Moscow. Earlier this month, Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser amid accusations he misled Vice President Pence and others over his contact with the Russian ambassador.</p> <p>House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called Wednesday night for Sessions’ resignation.</p> <p>“Jeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate,” she said. “Attorney General Sessions has never had the credibility to oversee the FBI investigation of senior Trump officials’ ties to the Russians.

I am deeply sorry for diminishing the significance of every life affected by Stephen Paddock’s terrorism last night and for the pain my words have inflicted on the loved ones of the victims. My shameful comments do not reflect the beliefs of my former employer, colleagues, family, and friends. Nor do they reflect my actual beliefs — this senseless violence warrants the deepest empathy. I understand and accept all consequences that my words have incurred.”</p> <p>A CBS spokeswoman told Fox News that Geftman-Gold, “who was with us for approximately one year, violated the standards of our company and is no longer an employee of CBS. Her views as expressed on social media are deeply unacceptable to all of us at CBS. Our hearts go out to the victims in Las Vegas and their families.”</p> <p>Geftman-Gold took to Facebook after a gunman opened fire at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas, killing at least 59 people and sending more than 510 others to hospitals.</p> <p>“If they wouldn’t do anything when children were murdered I have no hope that Repugs [sic] will ever do the right thing,” Geftman-Gold wrote in a now-deleted message that was first reported and captured by The Daily Caller.</p> <p>Geftman-Gold continued: “I’m actually not even sympathetic bc [sic] country music fans often are Republican gun toters [sic].”</p> <p>Geftman-Gold is presumably referring to Sandy Hook, which occurred in Newtown, Conn. back in 2012. A 20-year-old gunman, Adam Lanza, killed 20 children and six adults during the tragic event that sparked intense political debates regarding gun control.</p> <p>Her attorney, Carrie A. Goldberg, responded: “In the last few hours my client, her family and friends have been bombarded by online death unimaginable in quantity and detail.

This is because the bill’s primary author left the Senate in 2006, and the legislation he wrote has been public for all of eight days. “If there was an oral exam on the contents of the proposal, graded on a generous curve, only two Republicans could pass it,” a senior Republican aide told a reporter this week — before stipulating that the bill’s putative co-author, Lindsey Graham, was not one of them.</p> <p>But you need not take an anonymous aide’s word on it. On Tuesday, Vox’s Jeff Stein asked nine GOP senators what problems the Graham-Cassidy health-care bill solves, and how it solves them. The lawmakers responded with platitudes about federalism, the phrase “read the bill and you’ll understand,” and a bizarre reference to the final scene of Thelma and Louise.</p> <p>Still, Republicans know a few things about their latest iteration of Trumpcare. They know that the bill reforms one-sixth of the American economy so radically the Congressional Budget Office will need weeks to generate a detailed analysis of its likely effects; that every major health-care-industry stakeholder — from doctors and patients and hospitals to insurers and medical charities — opposes the legislation; that seven of their own party’s governors also oppose it; that health-care-policy analysts believe the bill would make health insurance unaffordable for many people with preexisting conditions; that it would radically reduce Medicaid and federal subsidies for health insurance; and that some analysts say those cuts would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 32 million over the next decade.</p> <p>And yet, according to reports, at least 48 Republican senators are ready to vote for the bill next week. Which raises the question: Why is almost every GOP senator ready to vote for widely reviled legislation that they do not understand?</p> <p>The popular answer is that they feel a political obligation to make good on their promises to the conservative base, regardless of the implications for public policy. Remarkably, several senators have stated, explicitly, that this is their calculus.</p> <p>“You know, I could maybe give you ten reasons why this bill shouldn’t be considered,” Iowa’s Chuck Grassley told reporters in his state Wednesday. “But Republicans campaigned on this so often that you have a responsibility to carry out what you said in the campaign. That’s pretty much as much of a reason as the substance of the bill.”</p> <p>Senators are not supposed to support legislation that they believe to be unworthy of consideration on substantive grounds just because they promised their voters that they would support a bill of that general type. The entire point of having a republic — as opposed to a direct democracy — is that the former enables elected representatives to exercise independent judgement in policy-making.</p> <p>Still, as contemptible as Grassley’s official rationale for supporting Graham-Cassidy is, his party’s actual motivation for pushing the bill is (almost certainly) more sinister. In truth, Graham-Cassidy does not fulfill the Republican Party’s promises to its voters — and there is virtually no evidence that said voters would punish the party for failing to pass it. The bill does, however, advance the priorities of the GOP’s big-dollar donors — and there is significant evidence that they would punish the Republican lawmakers if the legislation fails.</p> <p>It’s true that Republicans have spent nearly a decade promising voters that they would “repeal and replace Obamacare.” But most Republicans specifically promised to replace the law with one that would make health-care benefits more generous and universally affordable. Our Republican president promised to preserve Medicaid in its current form and achieve universal coverage with lower deductibles. The mogul even went so far as to explicitly disavow the conservative movement’s traditional hostility to the welfare state, telling 60 Minutes, “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.”</p> <p>Trump wasn’t the only one singing such a tune. Virtually all of the GOP’s leading lights attacked Obamacare from the left, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who lamented in January, “There are 25 million Americans who aren’t covered now … And many Americans who actually did get insurance — when they did not have it before — have really bad insurance that they have to pay for, and the deductibles are so high that it’s really not worth much to them.”</p> <p>McConnell, Trump, and their co-partisans pretended to support a more generous government health program for a reason: That is what most Republican voters want. Earlier this year, a Morning Consult survey found that a majority of conservatives — and a large plurality of self-identified tea-party supporters — thought that “the government should spend more on health care.”</p> <p>Turns out Tea Party voters want more government healthcare spending, yet support Ryan's healthcare bill. Go figure. https://t.co/y77gXZHn6j pic.twitter.com/VT7W2FqDPC — Guy Kawasaki (@GuyKawasaki) March 23, 2017</p> <p>Those findings are consistent with polling from Pew Research, which back in May found 61 percent of Republican voters saying that government funding levels for health care should be maintained or increased. Meanwhile, according to a recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 12 percent of all U.S. adults support cuts to Medicaid (which happens to be about the percentage of the public that supported the Senate’s previous Medicaid-gutting, Obamacare-repeal bill).</p> <p>Graham-Cassidy would cut federal spending on insurance subsides and the Medicaid expansion by an estimated $243 billion between 2020 and 2026. That is neither what Republicans campaigned on, nor what their constituents want.</p> <p>But it is what their most affluent donors want — or at least they believe it moves the ball in their desired direction. While Republican voters are broadly supportive of Medicaid — and many GOP senators from Medicaid-expansion states have touted their support for the policy — the conservative donor network funded by the oil billionaires Charles and David Koch has been unequivocal in its opposition to the federal program.</p> <p>“Our network voraciously opposed Medicaid expansion in state after state,” Tim Phillips, head of the Koch-funded nonprofit Americans for Prosperity, told GOP donors at the Koch Network’s June retreat. “These Republicans who expanded Medicaid were flatly wrong. So we’re going to continue holding these Republicans accountable.”</p> <p>At the same retreat, the Koch brothers themselves complained that the Republican health-care bill — which, at the time, already included significant cuts to Medicaid — was insufficiently conservative. That bill failed, amid widespread public opposition to its austerity. Senate Republicans responded by drafting a new iteration of Trumpcare that cuts Medicaid — and subsidies for health insurance — even more severely.</p> <p>In voting for Graham-Cassidy, Republican senators might fulfill promises they made to Charles Koch in Colorado Springs. But most would actually be breaking their promises to voters. Multiple GOP senators pledged to vote against any bill that failed to preserve protections for people with preexisting conditions, address the opioid crisis, or reduce insurance premiums.</p> <p>Graham-Cassidy fails to do all of these things. In fact, its scheme for block-granting federal health-care spending to the states is so haphazard and ill-thought-out, it would lead insurers to drastically increase their premiums, so as to protect themselves against market uncertainty.</p> <p>The notion that Republicans need to pass a bill that will increase the cost of health insurance — and break a variety of substantive promises to their constituents — for the sake of political expediency is bizarre. The only evidence for this view is that Republican voters still support “Obamacare repeal.” But if GOP lawmakers want to vote for a health-care bill that breaks their substantive promises to voters — and call it “Obamacare repeal” — they have better options.</p> <p>Days ago, Senate Democrats offered to support waivers that would allow red states to opt out of some Obamacare regulations, in exchange for funding to shore up the exchanges. This legislation would have averted a significant spike in insurance premiums next year — and, in keeping federal funding for health-care constant, it would have been closer to the substantive wishes of GOP voters than Graham-Cassidy is. What’s more, some Democrats were prepared to let President Trump call the measure “Obamacare repeal.”</p> <p>There is no reason to believe that the GOP’s political interests would be better served by passing a radical bill that will increase health-insurance premiums than by passing a bipartisan one that will reduce them — unless one stipulates that doing the latter would alienate big-dollar donors. Trump voters overwhelmingly approved of the president’s bipartisan debt-ceiling deal — and independents appear to have been even more enthusiastic.</p> <p>The GOP base is not allergic to bipartisanship and compromise, so long as it’s their champion who’s making the deals. But the Koch brothers are. The Kochs do not oppose Obamacare because the program doesn’t work well enough — they oppose it because they find it morally wrong for the state to take money from wealthy people and use it to subsidize health insurance for non-wealthy people. Thus, technocratic fixes that make government-subsidized health care work better are antithetical to their project. Their interest is not in improving the Affordable Care Act, but in discrediting the premise on which it is based: that redistributive government programs can improve health care for most Americans.</p> <p>And the Kochs and their ilk have made clear that Republicans who buck them will face consequences. This week, NBC News’ Kasie Hunt tweeted, “Republicans heard loud & clear from donors this August that do-nothing isn’t going to cut it.” At the Koch retreat in June, at least one major donor threatened to close “the Dallas piggy bank” until repeal was passed. In August, one Republican donor responded to the apparent death of Obamacare repeal by actually suing the party for fraud.</p> <p>Republicans don’t need donations from billionaires more than they need the votes of their base.

On fiscal matters, it is much riskier for Republicans to buck their donors than to betray the constituents who elected them.</p> <p>Senate Republicans are on the cusp of radically reforming our health-care system in ways that they do not fully understand — and that industry stakeholders and GOP voters broadly oppose — out of fear that a few dozen obscenely wealthy libertarians will evict them from Congress if they don’t.</p> <p>If Graham-Cassidy becomes law, our nation will enter a health-care crisis.

There is clearly a market for an underserved audience of religious Christians who would like to see themselves reflected in popular media more frequently. And there is clearly a market for being horrified by other people’s behavior. But it is exceptionally difficult, in a reality television context, to separate out and wall off the part of someone’s personality that is attractive and media-friendly from the parts that are less palatable to a mass audience. If you’re writing fiction for television, those attributes can get shaved off by the collective process of the writers’ room. But if you are, yourself, a reality television product, especially if you feel like you’re being suppressed or misrepresented, those parts of your personality and beliefs will inevitably out. Sometimes, the surprises are pleasant, as was the case on Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, where a family offered up as backwards and repellent proved to be tolerant, loving, and charming. But that is not often the case.</p> <p>For the most part, reality television producers and the networks that air their work, have decided that these outbursts are worth the risk of continuing to sell highly specific personalities, precisely because the cycle of suspension, response, and temporary profit loss are so well-established at this point that it can probably be worked into a budget. I can’t imagine anyone at A&E; is surprised that someone like Phil Robertson, who bills himself as a Bible-believing evangelical, believes that you can “Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,” or that he would say something like “It seems like, to me, a vagina — as a man — would be more desirable than a man’s anus. That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.” The question was probably when, not if.</p> <p>And when that when arrived, A&E; had a well road-tested formula to use in its response, provided by the folks at GLAAD. GLAAD is the most effective media advocacy organization that I know of, on two levels: first, its ability to swiftly identify and condemn anti-LGBT speech and to get results, and second, in its deep, comprehensive, and intersectional research on the depiction of LGBT characters and figures in media. When Robertson’s remarks broke, Wilson Cruz of GLAAD responded quickly with a statement that hit on an incredible number of ideas in a clear, efficient way.</p> <p>“Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil’s lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe,” he said. “He clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of Louisianans — and Americans — who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples. Phil’s decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E; and his sponsors, who now need to re-examine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT people and families.” It was a condemnation that positioned GLAAD as a more sophisticated and compassionate arbiter of Christian values than Robertson, drew a connection between culture and legal protection, and offered a reminder that GLAAD has plenty of experience influencing media sponsors.</p> <p>And A&E; knew immediately what it had to do to respond to GLAAD: Robertson was suspended for an indefinite period of time, a punishment that doesn’t just promise long-running financial losses to him, but because it has no end point, can’t be immediately decried as too short or too long. It’s action that effectively ends the news cycle, as far as A&E;’s need to take action and appear responsive are concerned.</p> <p>It’s also worth noting that because of GLAAD’s swift intervention, much of the media coverage has focused more on Robertson’s anti-gay remarks than his comments about African Americans and the Civil Rights movement, which weren’t worked into the narrative of the profile, but appeared as a pull quote in the online version of the piece. While Robertson’s views on homosexuality are presented as consistent with his religious beliefs, his remarks about African-Americans are actually more politically extreme, aimed at undermining the validity of the safety net.</p> <p>“I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I’m with the blacks, because we’re white trash. We’re going across the field,” Robertson said. “They’re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, ‘I tell you what: These doggone white people’ — not a word!… Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.”</p> <p>That’s a vision of the American South and American racial history that’s in keeping with Paula Deen’s alleged plantation nostalgia. It’s an attempt to substitute Robertson’s own memories of his interactions with African American laborers, whose behavior around him may well have been influenced by his relative privilege as a white man, even a poor one, for the larger history of organizing against and resistance to the economically and racially ruinous consequences of the Jim Crow system. It’s a kind of narrative that’s aimed at retroactively manufacturing black consent for policies aimed at maintaining white supremacy.</p> <p>But in the absence of an organization like GLAAD, which is extremely familiar to both media companies and media reporters, condemning those remarks, most of the entertainment reportage focused on Robertson’s anti-gay comments. That’s less a matter of disregard for racial bias, I think, than a focus instead on covering conflicts or potential conflicts between large organizations. And there’s a particularly strong incentive to cover disputes that could evolve into disputes with economic consequences, like the advertiser boycott GLAAD was clearly threatening. The NAACP did co-author a letter to A&E; with the Human Rights Campaign. But that letter didn’t mention advertisers, as GLAAD’s statement did, and I wonder if it might have been interpreted more as a sign of consensus among gay organizations, than as proof of a broad-based coalition that objected to a range of Robertson’s remarks. A&E; certainly reinforced that impression by focusing on the LGBT community in its statement announcing the suspension, explaining that “His personal views in no way reflect those of A+E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.”</p> <p>Normally, the lifecycle of the Duck Dynasty scandal would end with the suspension. But in an attempt to score political points off the controversy, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has decided to express his great sorrow about a supposed suppression of Phil Robertson’s right to free speech, which I was not aware included a guarantee to be paid to say whatever he pleased on a major television network’s airtime.</p> <p>“I don’t agree with quite a bit of stuff I read in magazine interviews or see on TV,” Jindal said in an official statement. “In fact, come to think of it, I find a good bit of it offensive. But I also acknowledge that this is a free country and everyone is entitled to express their views. In fact, I remember when TV networks believed in the First Amendment.It is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended “</p> <p>These sorts of statements are always hilariously hypocritical coming from conservatives who in all other spheres of their lives want private enterprises like A&E; to be able to do whatever they’d like. But it does suggest a particular frustration. Duck Dynasty does prove that there’s a definitive market for Christian figures in reality television. But the backlash to Robertson’s remarks does suggest that the market is limited to certain professions of Godliness, rather than to Phil Robertson’s entire theological or political program. And the fact that A&E; is willing to respond to GLAAD and other organizations does demonstrate that it prioritizes some consumers over others, and that it’s more interested in being seen as compliant with some norms than others. That’s a fairly definitive valuation of Christian consumers’ worth to mass media. And I can’t imagine that it’s a figure that makes Robertson, Jindal and plenty of other people particularly happy or comfortable.</p> <p>It’s easy, I suppose, to dismiss the coverage of Robertson’s remarks, his suspension, and Jindal’s follow-up as all-too-predictable.

Since May 2013, CBO’s spending projections have actually fallen by $600 billion over ten years. But at the same time, tax revenue will be $1.6 trillion lower, primarily due to slower economic growth.</p> <p>Falling budget deficits in recent years may seem like good news, but this is actually the result of both positive and negative developments. On the positive side, health care costs are growing slower than expected, which saves money for federal health programs. In January 2011, the CBO projected that Medicare would cost the government $6.5 trillion from 2012 to 2021. In today’s report, it estimates that Medicare will cost $5.8 trillion over the same period, meaning about $700 billion in savings. Projected Medicaid spending is also down about $500 billion over the same period. The other good news is that paying interest on the national debt is now projected to cost much less than before. Comparing the CBO’s January 2011 report with today’s, projected interest payments from 2012 to 2021 have fallen by about $1.4 trillion.</p> <p>However, some of the deficit reduction has been the result of misguided austerity in Congress. It has repeatedly slashed sectors that are critical to getting our economy back on track, such as job training and scientific research. Had these counter-productive choices not held back the economy, 2.4 million additional jobs could have been created since 2010. If Congress does not reverse course, the outlook does not look good. With over $1 trillion in cuts projected over the next ten years, nondefense discretionary spending will fall to the lowest level ever as a share of GDP since the federal government started tracking this category of spending in 1962.</p> <p>One of the worst outcomes of Congressional austerity was allowing emergency unemployment benefits to expire for over a million Americans who have been unemployed for at least six months. Millions of unemployed workers rely on these benefits to keep their families out of poverty while they look for work. Reduced benefits also mean reduced consumer spending, which leads to fewer jobs and slower economic growth. If Congress fixes this mistake and extends emergency unemployment benefits, the CBO estimates that GDP will increase by 0.2 percent and 200,000 additional jobs will be created this year.</p> <p>Instead, Congressional Republicans are pointing to the slightly higher budget deficits that would result from extending unemployment benefits and refusing to pass an extension until Congress can agree on how to pay for it. But the latest CBO projections reveal that there is no reason for Congress to hold up unemployment benefits over deficit concerns. That’s because projected spending on unemployment benefits has already fallen substantially over the last few years. In January 2011, the CBO projected that the federal government would spend $604 billion on unemployment insurance over the next decade, which assumed that extended benefits would expire. Now it projects that the same programs will cost $525 billion over the same ten-year period. A full year extension of emergency unemployment benefits would cost $26 billion, which means Congress can pass it and still spend over $50 billion less over a decade than the program was expected to cost back in 2011.</p> <p>Today’s CBO report shows that budget deficits are not an immediate concern.

He’s also given women a lot of reasons to dislike him for his porcine ways, and they have reciprocated with some terrible favorable/unfavorable ratings. A recent ABC News–Washington Post survey showed Trump at 29/68 among white women, a demographic group that only one Democrat (Bill Clinton in 1996) has carried since the 1960s.</p> <p>Yes, of course, Trump is reasonably popular among white men, and some would argue that his piggy-piggy baiting of women could help him push his margins in his honky-bro base even higher, especially in a race with Hillary Clinton where the Democrat would likely self-identify strongly with the offended. But there are only so many voters, and when you write off too many of them you eliminate any margin for error.</p> <p>Ron Brownstein shows how narrow Trump’s path to a general-election victory will be unless something fundamental changes:</p> <p>[I]f Clinton matched the usual Democratic performance with non-white voters and also carried even half of white women, Trump would then need to win more than three-fourths of white men for a national majority, a daunting prospect.</p> <p>“A daunting prospect” is one way of putting it. “Impossible” is another. Ronald Reagan won two-thirds of white men in his 1984 landslide victory over Fritz Mondale. Is Trump supposed to beat that? Seriously?</p> <p>No, Trump’s not going to carry all of the white men in America, particularly since he strikes many of the younger bros as a cartoon-villain representation of everything they dislike and fear about the baby-boom generation. So he’d be wise to explore ways to kiss and make up with the majority of Americans he’s disrespected.</p>",Not Ready to Support Trump,"not very, and is not likely ever to become, popular among minority voters<marker> given women a lot of reasons to dislike him for his porcine ways<marker>terrible favorable/unfavorable<marker>kiss and make up with the majority of Americans he’s disrespected.<marker>strikes many of the younger bros as a cartoon-villain representation of everything they dislike<marker>fear about the baby-boom generation<marker>",{},-5,-5,0|5|4|3,-5,Left,Left,Left,Correct,66ddbca9-d303-41e3-8480-b389b86e9d57,,,,,,,,

Had Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, still been on the court, Mr. Obama would likely have lost in a 5-4 decision that could have spanked him on broad constitutional grounds and imposed limits on future presidents, analysts said.</p> <p>Instead, the tie decision leaves in place rulings by a district judge in Texas and by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Mr. Obama broke the law when he claimed he had the categorical power to grant “deferred action” to nearly half of the illegal immigrants in the country.</p> <p>Republicans hailed it as a blow to Mr. Obama’s expansive claims of power, saying the court restored some of the balance that the country’s founders envisioned in the Constitution.</p> <p>SEE ALSO: In wake of ruling, immigrant activists demand Obama stop all deportations</p> <p>“The Supreme Court’s ruling makes the president’s executive action on immigration null and void. The Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws — only Congress is. This is another major victory in our fight to restore the separation of powers,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who is leading a similar lawsuit against Obamacare.</p> <p>Mr. Obama was not cowed. He said the justices never reached the big issues of the case, so it doesn’t affect any of his other policies, such as global warming and Obamacare.</p> <p>He said he will abide by the ruling, effectively ending his plans for the DAPA program. But he said most of those who would have qualified still won’t be deported because they are likely to have ties to the community and relatively clean criminal records.</p> <p>“They will remain low priorities for deportation,” he said.</p> <p>Hispanic rights groups vowed to make Republicans pay at the ballot box in November. They said the clearest way for illegal immigrants to gain legal status is to elect lawmakers who support a path to citizenship.</p> <p>“This act of cruelty delivered on immigrants by the Republican Party will serve as another watershed moment in the complete collapse of Latino and immigrant support for the GOP and its candidates,” said Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights at the Center for Community Change Action. “Our movement gets stronger when faced with anti-immigrant attacks.

Had Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, still been on the court, Mr. Obama would likely have lost in a 5-4 decision that could have spanked him on broad constitutional grounds and imposed limits on future presidents, analysts said.</p> <p>Instead, the tie decision leaves in place rulings by a district judge in Texas and by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Mr. Obama broke the law when he claimed he had the categorical power to grant “deferred action” to nearly half of the illegal immigrants in the country.</p> <p>Republicans hailed it as a blow to Mr. Obama’s expansive claims of power, saying the court restored some of the balance that the country’s founders envisioned in the Constitution.</p> <p>SEE ALSO: In wake of ruling, immigrant activists demand Obama stop all deportations</p> <p>“The Supreme Court’s ruling makes the president’s executive action on immigration null and void. The Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws — only Congress is. This is another major victory in our fight to restore the separation of powers,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who is leading a similar lawsuit against Obamacare.</p> <p>Mr. Obama was not cowed. He said the justices never reached the big issues of the case, so it doesn’t affect any of his other policies, such as global warming and Obamacare.</p> <p>He said he will abide by the ruling, effectively ending his plans for the DAPA program. But he said most of those who would have qualified still won’t be deported because they are likely to have ties to the community and relatively clean criminal records.</p> <p>“They will remain low priorities for deportation,” he said.</p> <p>Hispanic rights groups vowed to make Republicans pay at the ballot box in November. They said the clearest way for illegal immigrants to gain legal status is to elect lawmakers who support a path to citizenship.</p> <p>“This act of cruelty delivered on immigrants by the Republican Party will serve as another watershed moment in the complete collapse of Latino and immigrant support for the GOP and its candidates,” said Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights at the Center for Community Change Action. “Our movement gets stronger when faced with anti-immigrant attacks.

""On ENDA ... the ideal is to make sure that we can put it in law, make sure that it is deep in the DNA of our statutes.

But House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has signaled he won't give it a vote, and in the meantime, gay rights supporters are urging Obama to act.</p> <p>While presidential action would not be nearly as comprehensive as ENDA, it would protect as many as 16 million workers in the absence of congressional action. As it stands, it is currently legal in 33 states for an employer to fire or harass someone for being LGBT.</p> <p>Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, wouldn't say outright that Obama should move forward with executive action on ENDA. But she certainly signaled support for it.</p> <p>""I think the president should use his expected authority ... in as broad a way as he can to ensure that we can move this country forward,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""On ENDA ... the ideal is to make sure that we can put it in law, make sure that it is deep in the DNA of our statutes. But like I said, I think the president is committed to using his pen as much as possible to ensure as many Americans as we can are empowered to create opportunities for themselves and take advantage of those opportunities.""</p> <p>Asked if that is a yes, she replied, ""My answers stands.""</p> <p>Pelosi and Van Hollen emphasized that they, too, preferred that Congress act on the issue. They lamented that Boehner won't let the bill get a vote, despite the House bill having 200 cosponsors, including six Republicans.</p> <p>""The Speaker should just bring up the bill,"" Pelosi said. ""The ENDA thing is so clear cut. The votes are there. The Senate has passed it. It could be on the president's desk.""</p> <p>Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the assistant Democratic leader, said he feels ""very strongly"" that Obama should take executive action on ENDA and noted that it was an 1863 executive action by President Abraham Lincoln, the Emancipation Proclamation, that led to the end of slavery.</p> <p>""I don't know where I would be today if the executive order had not been used to get rid of slavery,"" said Clyburn, who is African-American. ""These were not laws passed by Congress. The ""Lincoln"" movie was all about trying to get the 13th Amendment, to make sure that it lasted after Lincoln left the presidency. But the slaves were freed by then.""</p> <p>This story has been updated to include further developments on Tuesday.</p>",Obama raises minimum wage for contractors,{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,Center,Left,NotByCenter,6d6e0d6f-ada1-4f61-a660-9a63b51a51e3,,,,,,,,

The prime minister of Iraq declared victory over ISIS on December 9. Republicans reached a deal that seemed to secure passage of a tax bill on December 15. Until then, it appeared possible that 2017 would end without an all-Republican government enacting any major legislation.</p> <p>Now the Republicans’ policy record looks better, at least as most conservatives see it. The tax bill advances several longstanding conservative objectives. It cuts tax rates for most Americans, slashes the corporate-tax rate for the first time in decades, expands the tax credit for children, limits the reach of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, and scales back the tax break for expensive homes. By scaling back the deduction for state and local taxes, it may encourage a more conservative fiscal politics in the states. And it allows drilling to proceed in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p> <p>The tax bill also partly makes up for the failure of Republican efforts earlier in 2017 to repeal Obamacare. The health-care law imposes fines on people who go without insurance. The tax bill sets the fines at zero. The least popular feature of Obamacare is thus effectively nullified.</p> <p>Some conservatives would have considered voting for Trump in November 2016 worth it just for Justice Neil Gorsuch. His appointment to the Supreme Court means that Justice Scalia’s seat will remain filled by an originalist for the next few decades. If one of the Democratic appointees or Justice Anthony Kennedy leaves the Court while Republicans hold the Senate, Trump will have the opportunity to create the first conservative majority in modern constitutional history. Trump has also nominated many well-qualified conservative jurists to the appeals courts. (The quality of his district-court nominees appears to be significantly lower.)</p> <p>x</p> <p>The administration has begun to rein in regulation. It has withdrawn and modified several of the Obama administration’s regulations, often in concert with Congress. It has stopped or slowed the progress of many others that were barreling down the tracks. The Environmental Protection Agency, now run by Trump appointee Scott Pruitt, has also taken steps to end the practice of “sue and settle,” in which activist groups get the agency to adopt new policies through lawsuits.</p> <p>Trump killed President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which would have imposed significant economic costs while doing little to reduce the risks of global warming. He has effectively ended the Obama administration’s mandate that employers provide contraceptive coverage: Employers who object to providing that coverage, or providing forms of that coverage they consider to cause abortions, are to be exempt. If the new policy stands, the Little Sisters of the Poor will be spending less time in court. Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has withdrawn Obama-era regulations that led colleges to lower the burden of proof for sexual-misconduct allegations and to monitor professors’ speech.</p> <p>Conservatives of various types have thus seen progress on their agenda in 2017.</p> <p>Most conservatives cheered two symbolic actions by the administration: announcing that our embassy in Israel will move to the country’s capital city of Jerusalem and that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. (I count that planned withdrawal as symbolic because the accord did not bind us to any policy commitments.)</p> <p>Conservatives of various types have thus seen progress on their agenda in 2017. Economic conservatives got tax cuts and some deregulation. Legal conservatives got judicial appointments and an executive branch more mindful of the limits of its policymaking authority. Social conservatives also benefited from the judicial appointments and welcomed Trump’s policy of blocking international family-planning funding from going to organizations that promote or perform abortions.</p> <p>Many Republicans credit Trump for presiding over a strong economy, too. It’s a point that requires some context. Job growth has not been quite as fast as it was in Obama’s last year, but you’d expect it to slow after an expansion this long. Republican economic policies may have played a role in keeping the expansion going. Certainly the predictions of economic doom made right after the election by some Trump opponents — chiefly Paul Krugman — have not come to pass.</p> <p>It’s not the only bad outcome that has been avoided. Trump has started no trade war and has not blown up the World Trade Organization. He has merely engaged in the low-grade protectionism that is routine for presidents of both parties, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership — which may not have been able to win congressional approval even if Trump had stayed in. NATO is still standing, too, and Trump’s complaints about allies’ burden-sharing may be arresting Western Europe’s slide into functional pacifism.</p> <p>How much Trump contributed to what has gone right in 2017 is debatable. He had less influence over the shape of the tax bill than most presidents exert over major laws. His unpopularity has probably dragged down the bill’s poll numbers. The failure on Obamacare was partly his. And if we have avoided a trade war, it may because he has hired people who are undercutting him. He has reportedly complained that he wants to go further in imposing tariffs but his advisers keep thwarting him.</p> <p>People who voted for Trump in November 2016 on the theory that he would deliver policies radically different from what other Republicans would do should be disappointed. Those who voted for him because he would usually line up with conservatives and sign Republican bills, on the other hand, have reason to be pleased with his policy record.</p> <p>They may not like everything about this presidency, the effects of which will not be limited to changes in public policy. Many of Trump’s conservative supporters share some of the concerns of the majority of Americans who oppose him. These conservatives wish the president had spoken more firmly and consistently to denounce the white supremacists in Charlottesville, or had kept his distance from Roy Moore, or had contained himself on Twitter. On policy matters, though, they are getting what they wanted from him.</p> <p>— Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor of National Review.

A version of this piece appears in the December 31, 2017 issue of National Review.","<p>Gorsuch confirmed, ISIS defeated, taxes cut: The Trump administration has compiled a solid record of accomplishment in its first year, one that compares well with the records of many of its predecessors.</p> <p>Two of the biggest accomplishments came late in the year. The prime minister of Iraq declared victory over ISIS on December 9. Republicans reached a deal that seemed to secure passage of a tax bill on December 15. Until then, it appeared possible that 2017 would end without an all-Republican government enacting any major legislation.</p> <p>Now the Republicans’ policy record looks better, at least as most conservatives see it. The tax bill advances several longstanding conservative objectives. It cuts tax rates for most Americans, slashes the corporate-tax rate for the first time in decades, expands the tax credit for children, limits the reach of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, and scales back the tax break for expensive homes. By scaling back the deduction for state and local taxes, it may encourage a more conservative fiscal politics in the states. And it allows drilling to proceed in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p> <p>The tax bill also partly makes up for the failure of Republican efforts earlier in 2017 to repeal Obamacare. The health-care law imposes fines on people who go without insurance. The tax bill sets the fines at zero. The least popular feature of Obamacare is thus effectively nullified.</p> <p>Some conservatives would have considered voting for Trump in November 2016 worth it just for Justice Neil Gorsuch. His appointment to the Supreme Court means that Justice Scalia’s seat will remain filled by an originalist for the next few decades. If one of the Democratic appointees or Justice Anthony Kennedy leaves the Court while Republicans hold the Senate, Trump will have the opportunity to create the first conservative majority in modern constitutional history. Trump has also nominated many well-qualified conservative jurists to the appeals courts. (The quality of his district-court nominees appears to be significantly lower.)</p> <p>x</p> <p>The administration has begun to rein in regulation. It has withdrawn and modified several of the Obama administration’s regulations, often in concert with Congress. It has stopped or slowed the progress of many others that were barreling down the tracks. The Environmental Protection Agency, now run by Trump appointee Scott Pruitt, has also taken steps to end the practice of “sue and settle,” in which activist groups get the agency to adopt new policies through lawsuits.</p> <p>Trump killed President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which would have imposed significant economic costs while doing little to reduce the risks of global warming. He has effectively ended the Obama administration’s mandate that employers provide contraceptive coverage: Employers who object to providing that coverage, or providing forms of that coverage they consider to cause abortions, are to be exempt. If the new policy stands, the Little Sisters of the Poor will be spending less time in court. Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has withdrawn Obama-era regulations that led colleges to lower the burden of proof for sexual-misconduct allegations and to monitor professors’ speech.</p> <p>Conservatives of various types have thus seen progress on their agenda in 2017.</p> <p>Most conservatives cheered two symbolic actions by the administration: announcing that our embassy in Israel will move to the country’s capital city of Jerusalem and that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. (I count that planned withdrawal as symbolic because the accord did not bind us to any policy commitments.)</p> <p>Conservatives of various types have thus seen progress on their agenda in 2017. Economic conservatives got tax cuts and some deregulation. Legal conservatives got judicial appointments and an executive branch more mindful of the limits of its policymaking authority. Social conservatives also benefited from the judicial appointments and welcomed Trump’s policy of blocking international family-planning funding from going to organizations that promote or perform abortions.</p> <p>Many Republicans credit Trump for presiding over a strong economy, too. It’s a point that requires some context. Job growth has not been quite as fast as it was in Obama’s last year, but you’d expect it to slow after an expansion this long. Republican economic policies may have played a role in keeping the expansion going. Certainly the predictions of economic doom made right after the election by some Trump opponents — chiefly Paul Krugman — have not come to pass.</p> <p>It’s not the only bad outcome that has been avoided. Trump has started no trade war and has not blown up the World Trade Organization. He has merely engaged in the low-grade protectionism that is routine for presidents of both parties, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership — which may not have been able to win congressional approval even if Trump had stayed in. NATO is still standing, too, and Trump’s complaints about allies’ burden-sharing may be arresting Western Europe’s slide into functional pacifism.</p> <p>How much Trump contributed to what has gone right in 2017 is debatable. He had less influence over the shape of the tax bill than most presidents exert over major laws. His unpopularity has probably dragged down the bill’s poll numbers. The failure on Obamacare was partly his. And if we have avoided a trade war, it may because he has hired people who are undercutting him. He has reportedly complained that he wants to go further in imposing tariffs but his advisers keep thwarting him.</p> <p>People who voted for Trump in November 2016 on the theory that he would deliver policies radically different from what other Republicans would do should be disappointed. Those who voted for him because he would usually line up with conservatives and sign Republican bills, on the other hand, have reason to be pleased with his policy record.</p> <p>They may not like everything about this presidency, the effects of which will not be limited to changes in public policy. Many of Trump’s conservative supporters share some of the concerns of the majority of Americans who oppose him. These conservatives wish the president had spoken more firmly and consistently to denounce the white supremacists in Charlottesville, or had kept his distance from Roy Moore, or had contained himself on Twitter. On policy matters, though, they are getting what they wanted from him.</p> <p>— Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor of National Review.

Students of Trump’s “university” are now pursuing a civil lawsuit accusing Trump University of fraud.

Corinthian Colleges, which actually offered degrees and was regionally accredited, damaged far more students’ lives.</p> <p>Although 80,000 people attended Trump University’s free introductory seminars, only 9,200 paid the $1,495 for three-day seminars and as few as 800 people paid thousands of dollars for the university’s mentorship and workshop packages, according to the Washington Post. But as many as 350,000 students who borrowed to attend Corinthian Colleges’ schools could benefit from student loan forgiveness from the federal government for being victims of fraud from the college chain.</p> <p>Instead of encouraging the government to investigate the for-profit college chain, Rubio asked for leniency in a letter to the U.S. Department of Education in the summer of 2014. The letter, which was obtained by Bloomberg Politics, read, in part, “While I commend the Department’s desire to protect our nation’s students from fraudulent and malicious activity by any institution of higher education, regardless of tax status, I believe the Department can and should demonstrate leniency as long as Corinthian Colleges, Inc. continues to expeditiously and earnestly cooperate by providing the documents requested.”</p> <p>Rubio has also accepted $27,600 in contributions from Corinthian Colleges throughout the past five years, Bloomberg reported.

Students of Trump’s “university” are now pursuing a civil lawsuit accusing Trump University of fraud. The trial could begin sometime in May.</p> <p>At Thursday’s debate, Rubio slammed Trump University for being a “fake school” that only left students with a “cardboard cutout of Donald Trump.”</p> <p>“There are people that borrowed $36,000 to go to Trump University and they are suing him now,” Rubio said.</p> <p>Although students paid thousands of dollars for Trump seminars, Rubio’s hands are not clean either, since he has supported a for-profit college chain that has hurt far more students than Trump University has. Corinthian Colleges, which actually offered degrees and was regionally accredited, damaged far more students’ lives.</p> <p>Although 80,000 people attended Trump University’s free introductory seminars, only 9,200 paid the $1,495 for three-day seminars and as few as 800 people paid thousands of dollars for the university’s mentorship and workshop packages, according to the Washington Post. But as many as 350,000 students who borrowed to attend Corinthian Colleges’ schools could benefit from student loan forgiveness from the federal government for being victims of fraud from the college chain.</p> <p>Instead of encouraging the government to investigate the for-profit college chain, Rubio asked for leniency in a letter to the U.S. Department of Education in the summer of 2014. The letter, which was obtained by Bloomberg Politics, read, in part, “While I commend the Department’s desire to protect our nation’s students from fraudulent and malicious activity by any institution of higher education, regardless of tax status, I believe the Department can and should demonstrate leniency as long as Corinthian Colleges, Inc. continues to expeditiously and earnestly cooperate by providing the documents requested.”</p> <p>Rubio has also accepted $27,600 in contributions from Corinthian Colleges throughout the past five years, Bloomberg reported.

And even if he manages to execute an about-face and to elicit expressions of forgiveness for his behavior, it’s doubtful Alabamans are going to want someone in the Senate who is as creepy as the Post story paints him as being when he was a grown-up prosecutor looking for love in exactly the wrong places.</p>","Roy Moore, the highly conservative Republican candidate for Alabama's open Senate seat, has been accused of sexually assaulting a 14 year old when he was 32 years old.",{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,Left,Left,Correct,748838dc-c056-408e-a9f4-d92268ce423c,,,,,,,,

Anthony Weiner’s sexting – in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election.</p> <p>""[FBI Director James Comey] himself has said he doesn’t know whether the emails ... are significant or not,"" Clinton told reporters in Iowa Friday evening. ""I’m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July. Therefore it’s imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay.""</p> <p>Earlier Friday, Comey informed top members of Congress in a letter that the bureau had “learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.”</p> <p>CLICK HERE TO READ THE LETTER</p> <p>Comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced “in connection with an unrelated case.”</p> <p>An FBI source, though, confirmed to Fox News that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced ex-Rep. Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. The New York Times first reported on the Weiner investigation connection, noting the FBI had been probing texts Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl.</p> <p>As Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seized on the FBI’s decision, interim Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile simply tweeted, “Good grief,” after the news of the Anthony Weiner connection broke. The Clinton campaign called the decision to revisit the case so close to the election “extraordinary,” and urged Comey to provide more details.</p> <p>Comey gave only a brief overview in his letter to lawmakers of what prompted their decision. He wrote that the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, “and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.”</p> <p>He said the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete “this additional work.”</p> <p>1,000 CLINTON-PETRAEUS EMAILS MISSING FROM RECORDS SENT TO STATE, FBI FILES SHOW</p> <p>FBI, DOJ ROILED BY DECISION TO LET CLINTON SLIDE, SAY SOURCES</p> <p>The move comes after Comey and the Justice Department decided in July not to pursue charges over Clinton's email practices, saying at the time that the investigation was finished.</p> <p>Comey later came under criticism from Trump, GOP lawmakers and others who claim the investigation downplayed the mishandling of classified information during Clinton's tenure.</p> <p>Trump, speaking to cheering supporters Friday afternoon in Manchester, N.H., praised the FBI for having the “courage” to “right the horrible mistake that they made” – saying he hopes that is “corrected.”</p> <p>“Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,” Trump said. “We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.”</p> <p>In a nod to the significance of the FBI’s announcement, Trump quipped: “The rest of my speech is going to be so boring.”</p> <p>Other GOP lawmakers also weighed in, urging the bureau to pursue a thorough new probe.</p> <p>“The FBI’s decision to reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton reinforces what the House Judiciary Committee has been saying for months: the more we learn about Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server, the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in a statement.</p> <p>Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the discovery must be “serious” for the bureau to investigate this close to the election.</p> <p>Clinton did not respond to questions from reporters about the development as she landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and did not address the matter while speaking to supporters in the same city.</p> <p>But Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta sharply questioned the FBI's move and said Comey should ""immediately provide"" more information.</p> <p>""Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call. In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign,” he said in a statement.</p> <p>Podesta said “we have no idea what those emails [that have come to light] are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.”</p> <p>According to a source connected to the Clinton campaign who spoke to law enforcement, the FBI has four devices – one belongs to Abedin, and at least one belongs to Weiner. So far, no classified information has been found on the devices, Fox News is told.</p> <p>The development comes 11 days before the general election, and is the latest shockwave to hit the race. Clinton had been gaining in the polls over Trump in the wake of the release of footage showing Trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him which he denies.</p> <p>However, daily revelations from hacked Clinton campaign emails obtained by WikiLeaks have become a headache for the Democrat's campaign. The resumption of the FBI probe poses a potentially bigger problem.</p> <p>Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI, told Fox News in a telephone interview that retired FBI officials were ""livid"" at Comey over the fact that charges were not brought against Clinton in round one of the investigation.</p> <p>""He lit her on fire and then walked away,"" Hosko said of Comey holding a news conference laying out Clinton's mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges.</p> <p>Hosko said he still defends Comey for not pressing charges because the FBI always has to make a decision ""based on what they have"" at the time.

""I’m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July. Therefore it’s imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay.""</p> <p>Earlier Friday, Comey informed top members of Congress in a letter that the bureau had “learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.”</p> <p>CLICK HERE TO READ THE LETTER</p> <p>Comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced “in connection with an unrelated case.”</p> <p>An FBI source, though, confirmed to Fox News that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced ex-Rep. Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. The New York Times first reported on the Weiner investigation connection, noting the FBI had been probing texts Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl.</p> <p>As Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seized on the FBI’s decision, interim Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile simply tweeted, “Good grief,” after the news of the Anthony Weiner connection broke. The Clinton campaign called the decision to revisit the case so close to the election “extraordinary,” and urged Comey to provide more details.</p> <p>Comey gave only a brief overview in his letter to lawmakers of what prompted their decision. He wrote that the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, “and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.”</p> <p>He said the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete “this additional work.”</p> <p>1,000 CLINTON-PETRAEUS EMAILS MISSING FROM RECORDS SENT TO STATE, FBI FILES SHOW</p> <p>FBI, DOJ ROILED BY DECISION TO LET CLINTON SLIDE, SAY SOURCES</p> <p>The move comes after Comey and the Justice Department decided in July not to pursue charges over Clinton's email practices, saying at the time that the investigation was finished.</p> <p>Comey later came under criticism from Trump, GOP lawmakers and others who claim the investigation downplayed the mishandling of classified information during Clinton's tenure.</p> <p>Trump, speaking to cheering supporters Friday afternoon in Manchester, N.H., praised the FBI for having the “courage” to “right the horrible mistake that they made” – saying he hopes that is “corrected.”</p> <p>“Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,” Trump said. “We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.”</p> <p>In a nod to the significance of the FBI’s announcement, Trump quipped: “The rest of my speech is going to be so boring.”</p> <p>Other GOP lawmakers also weighed in, urging the bureau to pursue a thorough new probe.</p> <p>“The FBI’s decision to reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton reinforces what the House Judiciary Committee has been saying for months: the more we learn about Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server, the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in a statement.</p> <p>Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the discovery must be “serious” for the bureau to investigate this close to the election.</p> <p>Clinton did not respond to questions from reporters about the development as she landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and did not address the matter while speaking to supporters in the same city.</p> <p>But Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta sharply questioned the FBI's move and said Comey should ""immediately provide"" more information.</p> <p>""Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call. In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign,” he said in a statement.</p> <p>Podesta said “we have no idea what those emails [that have come to light] are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.”</p> <p>According to a source connected to the Clinton campaign who spoke to law enforcement, the FBI has four devices – one belongs to Abedin, and at least one belongs to Weiner. So far, no classified information has been found on the devices, Fox News is told.</p> <p>The development comes 11 days before the general election, and is the latest shockwave to hit the race. Clinton had been gaining in the polls over Trump in the wake of the release of footage showing Trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him which he denies.</p> <p>However, daily revelations from hacked Clinton campaign emails obtained by WikiLeaks have become a headache for the Democrat's campaign. The resumption of the FBI probe poses a potentially bigger problem.</p> <p>Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI, told Fox News in a telephone interview that retired FBI officials were ""livid"" at Comey over the fact that charges were not brought against Clinton in round one of the investigation.</p> <p>""He lit her on fire and then walked away,"" Hosko said of Comey holding a news conference laying out Clinton's mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges.</p> <p>Hosko said he still defends Comey for not pressing charges because the FBI always has to make a decision ""based on what they have"" at the time.

KCNA/via REUTERS</p> <p>North Korea has developed a nuclear warhead for its new intercontinental ballistic missile, a confidential defense intelligence assessment revealed.</p> <p>North Korea has successfully miniaturized nuclear bombs for warhead production, a Defense Intelligence Agency report introduced, according to the Washington Post. As for the missiles on which such a warhead might be mounted, the North has a collection of short-, medium-, intermediate-, and long-range missiles that allow it to threaten its neighbors and even the continental United States.</p> <p>“The IC [intelligence community] assesses North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles,” the assessment explains. A similar assessment out of Japan also concludes that North Korea has achieved warhead miniaturization.</p> <p>Last year, North Korean state media released images of Kim Jong-un standing next to a spherical object which some experts suspect may be the warhead North Korea plans to load onto its missiles. Whether or not that is the nuclear payload remains unclear. North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test last September, at which point it claimed that it could mount a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile, a challenging technical feat that most analysts assumed was beyond North Korea.</p> <p>Kim Jong-un claimed in January that his country was on track to test an ICBM, another obstacle that some believed North Korea would struggle to overcome. Six months later, however, the North successfully tested the Hwasong-14, which experts assess can strike targets across the continental U.S.</p> <p>Many have suggested that the North has yet to develop a reliable re-entry vehicle, claiming that the re-entry vehicle failed during the last test of North Korea’s ICBM, but there is little evidence of failure.</p> <p>For too long, the U.S. and others have been in collective denial about North Korea’s capabilities.</p> <p>The bomb that North Korea tested late last year had a substantial explosive yield around 30 kilotons, roughly twice that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan during the Second World War. The U.S., according to the latest assessment, estimates that North Korea may have as many as 60 nuclear bombs in its arsenal, much higher than initially expected.</p> <p>North Korea has made marked achievements in the advancement of its missile program over the past year.</p> <p>The Pentagon assessed last month that the North will be able to field a reliable, nuclear-armed ICBM as early as next year, two years earlier than initially expected, but North Korea may be much closer than previously thought. North Korea has an ICBM, a powerful engine, an understanding of stage separation, a nuclear warhead, and a re-entry vehicle that can likely survive its trip back through the atmosphere. North Korea may still lack the necessary guidance controls for an intercontinental strike, but the country is moving in that direction.</p> <p>With a little more tweaking and testing, the North should be able to field a nuclear-armed ICBM. “Do not be surprised when North Korea tests a staged thermonuclear weapon,” renowned arms expert Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program in the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, tweeted in response to the WaPo article.</p> <p>Follow Ryan on Twitter</p> <p>Send tips to [email protected] dailycallernewsfoundation.org.</p> <p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

As for the missiles on which such a warhead might be mounted, the North has a collection of short-, medium-, intermediate-, and long-range missiles that allow it to threaten its neighbors and even the continental United States.</p> <p>“The IC [intelligence community] assesses North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles,” the assessment explains. A similar assessment out of Japan also concludes that North Korea has achieved warhead miniaturization.</p> <p>Last year, North Korean state media released images of Kim Jong-un standing next to a spherical object which some experts suspect may be the warhead North Korea plans to load onto its missiles. Whether or not that is the nuclear payload remains unclear. North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test last September, at which point it claimed that it could mount a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile, a challenging technical feat that most analysts assumed was beyond North Korea.</p> <p>Kim Jong-un claimed in January that his country was on track to test an ICBM, another obstacle that some believed North Korea would struggle to overcome. Six months later, however, the North successfully tested the Hwasong-14, which experts assess can strike targets across the continental U.S.</p> <p>Many have suggested that the North has yet to develop a reliable re-entry vehicle, claiming that the re-entry vehicle failed during the last test of North Korea’s ICBM, but there is little evidence of failure.</p> <p>For too long, the U.S. and others have been in collective denial about North Korea’s capabilities.</p> <p>The bomb that North Korea tested late last year had a substantial explosive yield around 30 kilotons, roughly twice that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan during the Second World War. The U.S., according to the latest assessment, estimates that North Korea may have as many as 60 nuclear bombs in its arsenal, much higher than initially expected.</p> <p>North Korea has made marked achievements in the advancement of its missile program over the past year.</p> <p>The Pentagon assessed last month that the North will be able to field a reliable, nuclear-armed ICBM as early as next year, two years earlier than initially expected, but North Korea may be much closer than previously thought. North Korea has an ICBM, a powerful engine, an understanding of stage separation, a nuclear warhead, and a re-entry vehicle that can likely survive its trip back through the atmosphere. North Korea may still lack the necessary guidance controls for an intercontinental strike, but the country is moving in that direction.</p> <p>With a little more tweaking and testing, the North should be able to field a nuclear-armed ICBM. “Do not be surprised when North Korea tests a staged thermonuclear weapon,” renowned arms expert Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program in the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, tweeted in response to the WaPo article.</p> <p>Follow Ryan on Twitter</p> <p>Send tips to [email protected] dailycallernewsfoundation.org.</p> <p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

An average Labour nominee not encumbered by Corbyn’s left-wing baggage would probably have won a clear victory.

To further this objective, they produced a memo that reads like talking points for one of the anti-Trump tirades that take up much of the day and night on CNN or MSNBC.</p> <p>In fact, the Intelligence Committee’s ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. – who few people had ever heard of before last year – has parlayed the endless Democratic conspiracy theories against President Trump into TV stardom. He gave 21 hours of TV interviews in 2017 to push his narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>The release of the Democratic memo was delayed because the Democrats deliberately included highly classified information that was difficult to declassify, so they could cry foul when the Trump administration refused to release this information. As a result, several sentences of the declassified memo were blacked out.</p> <p>The new Democratic memo … was part of an ongoing round-the-clock campaign to weaken President Trump, delegitimize his election, and make him look like a Russian puppet who needs to be impeached.</p> <p>Typical for a Schiff media interview, the Democratic rebuttal starts off with wild accusations against Republicans for “a transparent effort to undermine” the FBI, Justice Department, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and congressional Russia investigations.</p> <p>Among the major points of the rebuttal, the Democrats claim:</p> <p>(1) The Justice Department followed proper procedures and had compelling national security reasons for seeking a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance of Carter Page.</p> <p>(2) The FISA Court was properly informed about the partisan sponsorship of the Steele dossier, a series of memos compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>(3) The Steele dossier did not drive the FBI investigation of Page or a FISA warrant application to spy on him.</p> <p>The Democratic rebuttal tries to justify the Justice Department’s October 2016 FISA warrant application to spy on Page with sensationalistic claims that he was on the FBI’s radar for years due to his alleged contacts with Russian spies.</p> <p>The rebuttal also makes claims about Page’s interactions with Russians in mid-2016, when he reportedly was offered “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. It claims a supposed Russian-linked source told Page that Russia had thousands of Clinton’s emails that it could leak to hurt her campaign.</p> <p>However, many of Page’s alleged 2016 interactions with Russians have not been corroborated. Some come from the Steele dossier which, despite claims in the rebuttal, is still uncorroborated. Parts of the dossier have been shown to be untrue.</p> <p>The Democratic rebuttal also omits that Page had a brief, low-level role in the Trump campaign and was disparaged by a Russian intelligence officer in 2015 as “an idiot.”</p> <p>Like Schiff’s frequent TV news interviews, the rebuttal misrepresents or omits many inconvenient facts. Two of these make the entire rebuttal impossible to take seriously.</p> <p>First, the Republican memo said that Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified in a closed session in December 2017 that no warrant to spy on Page would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information. This is one of the most crucial points in the Republican memo, but the Democrats ignored it.</p> <p>Instead, the Democratic rebuttal dances around McCabe’s statement by stating that other information drove the FBI investigation. The Democratic memo says the Justice Department “provided additional information obtained through multiple corroborated sources that corroborated Steele’s reporting” in the FISA warrant application.</p> <p>This is a major omission. Either McCabe did or did not say the Steele dossier was the crucial information that drove the FISA warrant request.</p> <p>The committee’s Republicans should declassify the transcript of McCabe’s remarks to expose what is very likely a huge Democratic misrepresentation.</p> <p>Second, the Democratic rebuttal engages in verbal gymnastics to dispute Republican claims that the Justice Department failed to inform the FISA Court about the political sponsorship of the Steele dossier.</p> <p>The rebuttal tries to do this by citing a vague sentence from a footnote in the October 2016 FISA warrant request that said: “The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate 1’s [Donald Trump’s] campaign.”</p> <p>The “identified U.S. person” was Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS, a company that was paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and in turn contracted with Steele to produce the dossier critical of Trump. This was not revealed to the FISA Court.</p> <p>This gobbledygook on the FBI “speculating” that an unidentified U.S. person was seeking information to discredit the Trump campaign was designed to conceal from the FISA Court that the Steele memo was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. Incredibly, the Democratic rebuttal has no references whatsoever to the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>In fact, the footnote cited by the Democrats strengthens the Republican claim that the October FISA warrant request omitted crucial information on the veracity of the Steele dossier.</p> <p>The FISA judge obviously should have been told that a political party and a presidential campaign from one party funded a dossier to justify a FISA warrant to spy on a former member of a presidential campaign of the other political party. The Democrats’ claim that the Justice Department “accurately” informed the court about this matter is laughable.</p> <p>The highly misleading Democratic rebuttal is already having the intended effect by giving talking heads on TV news shows talking points to claim that the rebuttal disproved the Republican memo and provides evidence of collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.</p> <p>Expect Adam Schiff to be on TV as often as he can in coming days claiming his memo corrects the record. But the reality is that the Democratic rebuttal is full of the same unsubstantiated partisan claims that Schiff and other House Intelligence Committee Democrats have been making for over a year. It fails to rebut any of the serious allegations made by the committee’s Republicans.</p> <p>The bottom line: don’t believe Adam Schiff when he hawks this fake rebuttal. He didn’t lay a glove on the Republican memo on serious abuses of the FISA process by the Justice Department, and the FBI to undermine the Trump presidential campaign.</p>",The House Intelligence Committee released a redacted Democratic memo written to rebut the Republican memo that alleges bias at the DOJ and FBI against the Trump campaign in the Russia probe.,"In fact, the Intelligence Committee’s ranking member, Rep.

To further this objective, they produced a memo that reads like talking points for one of the anti-Trump tirades that take up much of the day and night on CNN or MSNBC.</p> <p>In fact, the Intelligence Committee’s ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. – who few people had ever heard of before last year – has parlayed the endless Democratic conspiracy theories against President Trump into TV stardom. He gave 21 hours of TV interviews in 2017 to push his narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>The release of the Democratic memo was delayed because the Democrats deliberately included highly classified information that was difficult to declassify, so they could cry foul when the Trump administration refused to release this information. As a result, several sentences of the declassified memo were blacked out.</p> <p>The new Democratic memo … was part of an ongoing round-the-clock campaign to weaken President Trump, delegitimize his election, and make him look like a Russian puppet who needs to be impeached.</p> <p>Typical for a Schiff media interview, the Democratic rebuttal starts off with wild accusations against Republicans for “a transparent effort to undermine” the FBI, Justice Department, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and congressional Russia investigations.</p> <p>Among the major points of the rebuttal, the Democrats claim:</p> <p>(1) The Justice Department followed proper procedures and had compelling national security reasons for seeking a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance of Carter Page.</p> <p>(2) The FISA Court was properly informed about the partisan sponsorship of the Steele dossier, a series of memos compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>(3) The Steele dossier did not drive the FBI investigation of Page or a FISA warrant application to spy on him.</p> <p>The Democratic rebuttal tries to justify the Justice Department’s October 2016 FISA warrant application to spy on Page with sensationalistic claims that he was on the FBI’s radar for years due to his alleged contacts with Russian spies.</p> <p>The rebuttal also makes claims about Page’s interactions with Russians in mid-2016, when he reportedly was offered “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. It claims a supposed Russian-linked source told Page that Russia had thousands of Clinton’s emails that it could leak to hurt her campaign.</p> <p>However, many of Page’s alleged 2016 interactions with Russians have not been corroborated. Some come from the Steele dossier which, despite claims in the rebuttal, is still uncorroborated. Parts of the dossier have been shown to be untrue.</p> <p>The Democratic rebuttal also omits that Page had a brief, low-level role in the Trump campaign and was disparaged by a Russian intelligence officer in 2015 as “an idiot.”</p> <p>Like Schiff’s frequent TV news interviews, the rebuttal misrepresents or omits many inconvenient facts. Two of these make the entire rebuttal impossible to take seriously.</p> <p>First, the Republican memo said that Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified in a closed session in December 2017 that no warrant to spy on Page would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information. This is one of the most crucial points in the Republican memo, but the Democrats ignored it.</p> <p>Instead, the Democratic rebuttal dances around McCabe’s statement by stating that other information drove the FBI investigation. The Democratic memo says the Justice Department “provided additional information obtained through multiple corroborated sources that corroborated Steele’s reporting” in the FISA warrant application.</p> <p>This is a major omission. Either McCabe did or did not say the Steele dossier was the crucial information that drove the FISA warrant request.</p> <p>The committee’s Republicans should declassify the transcript of McCabe’s remarks to expose what is very likely a huge Democratic misrepresentation.</p> <p>Second, the Democratic rebuttal engages in verbal gymnastics to dispute Republican claims that the Justice Department failed to inform the FISA Court about the political sponsorship of the Steele dossier.</p> <p>The rebuttal tries to do this by citing a vague sentence from a footnote in the October 2016 FISA warrant request that said: “The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate 1’s [Donald Trump’s] campaign.”</p> <p>The “identified U.S. person” was Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS, a company that was paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and in turn contracted with Steele to produce the dossier critical of Trump. This was not revealed to the FISA Court.</p> <p>This gobbledygook on the FBI “speculating” that an unidentified U.S. person was seeking information to discredit the Trump campaign was designed to conceal from the FISA Court that the Steele memo was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. Incredibly, the Democratic rebuttal has no references whatsoever to the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>In fact, the footnote cited by the Democrats strengthens the Republican claim that the October FISA warrant request omitted crucial information on the veracity of the Steele dossier.</p> <p>The FISA judge obviously should have been told that a political party and a presidential campaign from one party funded a dossier to justify a FISA warrant to spy on a former member of a presidential campaign of the other political party. The Democrats’ claim that the Justice Department “accurately” informed the court about this matter is laughable.</p> <p>The highly misleading Democratic rebuttal is already having the intended effect by giving talking heads on TV news shows talking points to claim that the rebuttal disproved the Republican memo and provides evidence of collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.</p> <p>Expect Adam Schiff to be on TV as often as he can in coming days claiming his memo corrects the record. But the reality is that the Democratic rebuttal is full of the same unsubstantiated partisan claims that Schiff and other House Intelligence Committee Democrats have been making for over a year. It fails to rebut any of the serious allegations made by the committee’s Republicans.</p> <p>The bottom line: don’t believe Adam Schiff when he hawks this fake rebuttal. He didn’t lay a glove on the Republican memo on serious abuses of the FISA process by the Justice Department, and the FBI to undermine the Trump presidential campaign.</p>",The House Intelligence Committee released a redacted Democratic memo written to rebut the Republican memo that alleges bias at the DOJ and FBI against the Trump campaign in the Russia probe.,{},{},2.5,5,0|5|4|1,3.75,Right,Right,Right,Correct,806dfa97-a252-4382-bb37-a819b4e24383,,,,,,,,

Then, on Sunday night, before an audience of 66.5 million, the GOP nominee claimed that he had never kissed or groped a woman without her permission.</p> <p>Days later, several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault against Trump. Many claimed that they were inspired to do so after seeing the Republican standard-bearer’s blanket denial at the second presidential debate.</p> <p>But is that claim really credible? Isn’t it more likely that the Clinton campaign dispatched private investigators to every corner of the country to seek out women who had been groped by Donald Trump, and then — once they had identified a random handful of women who had been, or at least were willing to say that they were — instructed those women to keep their allegations quiet until the week of October 10, when two of them would go to the New York Times, while another would give her story to the Palm Beach Post, since that paper’s relative obscurity would make the idea that Clinton had planted the story seem preposterous? Doesn’t that just make more sense?</p> <p>If you find that reasoning compelling, you might be Joe Scarborough.</p> <p>“I’m skeptical about the timing of all of this dropping. Talk about an October surprise,” the host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe said Thursday. “When, as you said, there have been a thousand triggering events. If I had been sexually harassed by this man, the Megyn Kelly story would have given me an opportunity … I’m just asking why, suddenly, all of this stuff is blowing up in October. Perhaps, it’s all innocent … I’m just saying skepticism is a good thing.”</p> <p>Msnbc's Morning Joe Scarborough says he's skeptical about latest Trump accusations. Why now? #NextFakeTrumpVictim https://t.co/rKY2SsSIZW — MicroSpookyLeaks™ (@WDFx2EU7) October 13, 2016</p> <p>Scarborough’s skepticism centers on the question “Why are women only coming forward now, when Trump has been campaigning as a misogynist for over a year?” There are at least three simple answers to this question:</p> <p>1. The number of Americans closely following the presidential election is much higher now than it was when Trump was feuding with Megyn Kelly during the GOP primary.</p> <p>2. Women did come forward with accusations of sexual assault months ago. The New York Times ran a long story on Trump “crossing the line” with women — including, allegedly, kissing and groping them without their permission — back in May. A former Miss USA–pageant contestant claimed that Trump had groped her in a Facebook post published in June. And the full trail of sexual-assault allegations against Trump goes back decades, to depositions from the mogul’s first divorce, in which Ivana Trump accused her ex-husband of rape.</p> <p>3. Last week, a video of Trump all but confessing to sexual assault surfaced and became both the biggest news story in the United States and the subject of one of the first questions at a presidential debate.</p> <p>On this last point, conservatives may have some cause for griping. While there’s no reason to believe that Trump’s latest accusers were saving their allegations for October, there’s some evidence that NBC was saving its Access Hollywood footage for the right moment. Earlier this week, anonymous NBC executives told TMZ that the network had known about the tape for at least two months. According to TMZ’s report, NBC had planned to release the video before the second debate, but decided to bump it so the story wouldn’t compete with Hurricane Matthew for attention. This narrative is disputed by the network, but it’s plausible.</p> <p>Still, it’s worth noting that NBC is closely guarding the mother lode of Trump hot-mic videos — the outtakes from The Apprentice. The Clinton campaign is not pulling the Peacock’s strings.</p> <p>The fact that we are talking about Trump’s sexual misconduct in October is not a product of some Clintonian conspiracy. Rather, it’s the product of the Clinton campaign’s competent messaging.</p> <p>There’s no question that the Democratic nominee wanted the media to put its spotlight on Trump’s misogyny this month. Which is why she brought up the story of Alicia Machado at the first debate, and launched an ad starring the Miss Universe winner immediately afterward.</p> <p>And, even before the Access Hollywood video dropped, the Machado story had sparked multiple news cycles about Trump’s long history of misogynistic comments and behavior. If America never became privy to Trump’s backstage conversation with Billy Bush, then we’d be talking more about the “Howard Stern tapes” — particularly, the clip in which Trump brags about his habit of deliberately walking in on beauty-pageant contestants while they’re changing. Which, like Trump’s boasts about sexual assault, were subsequently corroborated by multiple beauty queens, including contestants in Miss Teen USA, a pageant that included girls as young as 14.</p> <p>Over the past 48 hours, many conservatives have suggested that the liberal media suppressed news of Trump’s raging misogyny throughout the GOP primary, and then unleashed all the worst bits right when it would do maximum damage to the Republican Party. This idea is absurd. One of the first questions at the very first GOP debate concerned Trump’s history of demeaning comments toward women. Newspapers and magazines dug into past allegations of sexual abuse against Trump and aired them ahead of Super Tuesday.</p> <p>If only media reported during the primary on assault allegations against Trump he might not be nominee.</p> <p>Oh wait.https://t.co/fcFhS1DyIS pic.twitter.com/xQ7Gq6O7E8 — Nick MOWMEN (@NickBaumann) October 13, 2016</p> <p>GOP opposition researchers may not have had access to the Billy Bush tape. But no special access was required to dig through the archives of Howard Stern’s show. If Marco Rubio wanted to make Trump’s mistreatment of women a central story line in the GOP primary, he could have introduced Alicia Machado’s story at a Republican debate. Or his campaign could have leaked Trump’s most retrograde Howard Stern comments to CNN. Or he could have highlighted the many accusations of sexual assault already reported and on the record. He chose not to do so.</p> <p>When Trump’s misogyny was raised at that first debate, the mogul argued that any objection to his treatment of women was an example of political correctness run amok. There were nine other candidates on the stage that night. None saw a political advantage in challenging the mogul’s assertion. Conservatives should ask themselves why that is.</p>","Following the release of the 2005 taped comments made by Donald Trump, and his defense during the 2nd presidential debate that they were just ""locker room talk"", multiple women have come forth saying that he sexually assaulted them.","Donald Trump bragged about his affinity for serial sexual assault (or, more precisely, kissing women and grabbing them by their genitals without waiting for consent)<marker>Trump’s misogyny was raised at that first debate<marker>",{},-5,-2.5,0,-3.75,Left,,,,8b880a68-71f1-4b42-9f74-7b968bf5f9c3,,,,,OK,,,

Unlike most campaign stories, Trump’s remarks grabbed the attention of nearly the entire American electorate. Then, on Sunday night, before an audience of 66.5 million, the GOP nominee claimed that he had never kissed or groped a woman without her permission.</p> <p>Days later, several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault against Trump. Many claimed that they were inspired to do so after seeing the Republican standard-bearer’s blanket denial at the second presidential debate.</p> <p>But is that claim really credible? Isn’t it more likely that the Clinton campaign dispatched private investigators to every corner of the country to seek out women who had been groped by Donald Trump, and then — once they had identified a random handful of women who had been, or at least were willing to say that they were — instructed those women to keep their allegations quiet until the week of October 10, when two of them would go to the New York Times, while another would give her story to the Palm Beach Post, since that paper’s relative obscurity would make the idea that Clinton had planted the story seem preposterous? Doesn’t that just make more sense?</p> <p>If you find that reasoning compelling, you might be Joe Scarborough.</p> <p>“I’m skeptical about the timing of all of this dropping. Talk about an October surprise,” the host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe said Thursday. “When, as you said, there have been a thousand triggering events. If I had been sexually harassed by this man, the Megyn Kelly story would have given me an opportunity … I’m just asking why, suddenly, all of this stuff is blowing up in October. Perhaps, it’s all innocent … I’m just saying skepticism is a good thing.”</p> <p>Msnbc's Morning Joe Scarborough says he's skeptical about latest Trump accusations. Why now? #NextFakeTrumpVictim https://t.co/rKY2SsSIZW — MicroSpookyLeaks™ (@WDFx2EU7) October 13, 2016</p> <p>Scarborough’s skepticism centers on the question “Why are women only coming forward now, when Trump has been campaigning as a misogynist for over a year?” There are at least three simple answers to this question:</p> <p>1. The number of Americans closely following the presidential election is much higher now than it was when Trump was feuding with Megyn Kelly during the GOP primary.</p> <p>2. Women did come forward with accusations of sexual assault months ago. The New York Times ran a long story on Trump “crossing the line” with women — including, allegedly, kissing and groping them without their permission — back in May. A former Miss USA–pageant contestant claimed that Trump had groped her in a Facebook post published in June. And the full trail of sexual-assault allegations against Trump goes back decades, to depositions from the mogul’s first divorce, in which Ivana Trump accused her ex-husband of rape.</p> <p>3. Last week, a video of Trump all but confessing to sexual assault surfaced and became both the biggest news story in the United States and the subject of one of the first questions at a presidential debate.</p> <p>On this last point, conservatives may have some cause for griping. While there’s no reason to believe that Trump’s latest accusers were saving their allegations for October, there’s some evidence that NBC was saving its Access Hollywood footage for the right moment. Earlier this week, anonymous NBC executives told TMZ that the network had known about the tape for at least two months. According to TMZ’s report, NBC had planned to release the video before the second debate, but decided to bump it so the story wouldn’t compete with Hurricane Matthew for attention. This narrative is disputed by the network, but it’s plausible.</p> <p>Still, it’s worth noting that NBC is closely guarding the mother lode of Trump hot-mic videos — the outtakes from The Apprentice. The Clinton campaign is not pulling the Peacock’s strings.</p> <p>The fact that we are talking about Trump’s sexual misconduct in October is not a product of some Clintonian conspiracy. Rather, it’s the product of the Clinton campaign’s competent messaging.</p> <p>There’s no question that the Democratic nominee wanted the media to put its spotlight on Trump’s misogyny this month. Which is why she brought up the story of Alicia Machado at the first debate, and launched an ad starring the Miss Universe winner immediately afterward.</p> <p>And, even before the Access Hollywood video dropped, the Machado story had sparked multiple news cycles about Trump’s long history of misogynistic comments and behavior. If America never became privy to Trump’s backstage conversation with Billy Bush, then we’d be talking more about the “Howard Stern tapes” — particularly, the clip in which Trump brags about his habit of deliberately walking in on beauty-pageant contestants while they’re changing. Which, like Trump’s boasts about sexual assault, were subsequently corroborated by multiple beauty queens, including contestants in Miss Teen USA, a pageant that included girls as young as 14.</p> <p>Over the past 48 hours, many conservatives have suggested that the liberal media suppressed news of Trump’s raging misogyny throughout the GOP primary, and then unleashed all the worst bits right when it would do maximum damage to the Republican Party. This idea is absurd. One of the first questions at the very first GOP debate concerned Trump’s history of demeaning comments toward women. Newspapers and magazines dug into past allegations of sexual abuse against Trump and aired them ahead of Super Tuesday.</p> <p>If only media reported during the primary on assault allegations against Trump he might not be nominee.</p> <p>Oh wait.https://t.co/fcFhS1DyIS pic.twitter.com/xQ7Gq6O7E8 — Nick MOWMEN (@NickBaumann) October 13, 2016</p> <p>GOP opposition researchers may not have had access to the Billy Bush tape. But no special access was required to dig through the archives of Howard Stern’s show. If Marco Rubio wanted to make Trump’s mistreatment of women a central story line in the GOP primary, he could have introduced Alicia Machado’s story at a Republican debate. Or his campaign could have leaked Trump’s most retrograde Howard Stern comments to CNN. Or he could have highlighted the many accusations of sexual assault already reported and on the record. He chose not to do so.</p> <p>When Trump’s misogyny was raised at that first debate, the mogul argued that any objection to his treatment of women was an example of political correctness run amok. There were nine other candidates on the stage that night. None saw a political advantage in challenging the mogul’s assertion. Conservatives should ask themselves why that is.</p>","Following the release of the 2005 taped comments made by Donald Trump, and his defense during the 2nd presidential debate that they were just ""locker room talk"", multiple women have come forth saying that he sexually assaulted them.",affinity<marker>claimed<marker>argued<marker>,{},-2.5,0,0,-1.25,Left,Left,Left,Correct,8b880a68-71f1-4b42-9f74-7b968bf5f9c3,,,,,,,,

Sifting through the connections between foreign CEOs’ business dealings, foundation donations that were only partially disclosed, speaking fees collected by Bill Clinton, and decisions made by the former secretary of State is certainly “mind boggling,” but so far there’s no smoking gun.</p> <p>The biggest revelation so far concerns the sale of one of the United States’ largest uranium mines to Russia’s state atomic energy agency, Rosatom. The Wyoming mine — which could produce as much as half of the U.S. uranium supply this year, according to The Wall Street Journal — was formerly owned by the Canadian company Uranium One, but from 2009 to 2013 the Russians took control of the company. Because the $610 million sale could have national security implications for the U.S., it had to be approved by a federal committee composed of several government agencies. Here’s how the Clintons were involved: Hillary’s State Department was one of the agencies that approved the deal in 2010, and the New York Times reports that during that time Uranium One’s chairman, Ian Telfer, made four donations to the Clinton Foundation via his family foundation, totaling $2.35 million. Despite the Clintons’ agreement with the Obama administration, those donations were not disclosed.</p> <p>While that sounds fishy, so far there’s no evidence that the donations affected the deal’s approval. In addition to the secretary of State, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) includes the attorney general and the secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy. It’s also possible that the decision was made by deputies or assistant secretaries in those agencies, not the cabinet members themselves. The Clinton campaign provided a statement from a former assistant secretary of State who said Clinton “never intervened” while he was handling CFIUS matters. Telfer said he made the donations to support his business partner, the Canadian mining executive Frank Giustra, and “the donations started before there was any idea of this takeover.”</p> <p>Speaking of Giustra, Politico reports that he’s the subject of another tale from Clinton Cash. Giustra sits on the Clinton Foundation’s board, has pledged more than $100 million to the foundation, and cofounded the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p> <p>President Donald Trump’s lawyer accused Special Counsel Robert Mueller of violating attorney client privilege in obtaining emails sent by Trump’s transition team in a letter sent to Congress Saturday.</p> <p>Counsel to the transition team known as Trump For America, Kory Langhofer claims the General Services Administration, the government agency that possessed the transition team emails, turned them over to Mueller’s team before Trump’s lawyers were given the opportunity to review them and assert they should be protected under attorney client privilege.</p> <p>“The materials produced by the G.S.A. to the special counsel’s office therefore included materials protected by the attorney-client privilege, the deliberative process privilege, and the presidential communications privilege,” Langhofer, Counsel to Trump For America, wrote in the letter, obtained by Politico.</p> <p>Mueller’s office refuted the allegation, insisting they obtained the emails and other documents through the requisite legal channels.</p> <p>“When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner’s consent or appropriate criminal process,” Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel’s office, said in a statement.</p> <p>Mueller’s team reportedly used the roughly 7,000 transition emails as a basis for questioning witnesses and confirming leads, according to Axios, which first reported Mueller had obtained the communications.</p> <p>The letter accuses GSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt of unlawfully furnishing the emails for Mueller’s team after then-GSA general counsel Richard Beckler “acknowledged unequivocally” to the Trump campaign on June 15 that the emails were their legal property and as such “any requests for the production of PTT [Presidential Transition Team] records would therefore be routed to legal counsel for [the Trump campaign].”</p> <p>Lowentritt denied that Beckler, who has since passed away, made any such commitment in a statement to Buzzfeed News.</p> <p>The allegations of impropriety come days after the Department of Justice (DOJ) released over 300 politically charged text messages exchanged by Peter Strzok — the FBI agent who was dismissed from Mueller’s team for anti Trump bias — and a senior FBI attorney Lisa Page. The texts, which were turned over to the House Intelligence Committee and obtained by multiple news outlets Tuesday, bolstered the Republican effort to cast Mueller’s probe as compromised by political bias.</p> <p>WATCH:</p> <p>Follow Jack on Twitter</p> <p>The Daily Caller News Foundation is working hard to balance out the biased American media.

Kenneth Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands, also impacted by the hurricanes.</p> <p>The White House summary -- known as a “readout” -- of the Sunday phone calls twice included the word “leadership.”</p> <p>“President Trump thanked the governors for their leadership in responding to and recovering from these catastrophic events,” read one line.</p> <p>“President Trump pledged his administration’s continued commitment to provide an unprecedented federal response in helping the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Both governors were very appreciative and complimentary of the administration’s effort, including the president’s leadership,” the summary also stated.</p> <p>He also tweeted Saturday: ""Results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by San Juan Mayor. Doing everything we can to help great people of PR!""</p> <p>Cruz, in response, said later Saturday morning that she’ll “continue to do whatever I have to do” to get federal hurricane assistance.</p> <p>“I will continue to do whatever I have to do, say whatever I have to say, compliment the people I need to compliment and call out the people I need to call out,” she told MSNBC. “I am not going to be distracted by small comments, by politics, by petty issues. This is one goal and it's to save lives.”</p> <p>Trump later tweeted: “The Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, is a great guy and leader who is really working hard. Thank you Ricky!”</p> <p>He also tweeted: “Just spoke to Governor Kenneth Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands who stated that #FEMA and Military are doing a GREAT job! Thank you Governor!”</p>","In a series of tweets this morning, President Trump defended his administration's response to the crisis in Puerto Rico and dismissed critics as ""fake news"" and ""politically motivated ingrates."" These statements came after the President criticized the mayor of San Juan on Saturday, who had been skeptical of the pace of the relief efforts.",{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,Left,Right,Not,a08dfb11-c6fe-45c3-b048-66b748b5d6c8,,,,,,,,

Trump, describing those who advised him on foreign policy, called Papadopoulos an ""energy and oil consultant, excellent guy.</p> <p>Papadopoulos is also seen in a March 2016 Instagram photo with Trump, Sessions and 10 other ""national security"" advisers.</p> <p>The Washington Post reported in April 2016 that Papadopoulos may have exaggerated his resume.

And there is a procedure for that, which I would follow,” he said, as noted by the Democratic opposition research group American Bridge. “I believe that would be the best approach for the country because we can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute.

Not all transgender people are diagnosed with gender dysphoria; some don’t experience that distress.</p> <p>LGBTQ rights groups slammed Trump for making the change solely to appease his conservative base.</p> <p>“This has been studied extensively, and the consensus is clear: There are no cost or military readiness drawbacks associated with allowing trans people to fight for their country,” said Joshua Block, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project. “The president is trying to score cheap political points on the backs of military personnel who have put their lives on the line for their country.”</p> <p>Gregory Angelo, the president of Log Cabin Republicans, a group that represents LGBTQ conservatives, said Trump’s move “smacks of politics, pure and simple.”</p> <p>“The United States military already includes transgender individuals who protect our freedom day in and day out,” Angelo said. “Excommunicating transgender soldiers only weakens our readiness; it doesn’t strengthen it.”</p> <p>The president’s action completely contradicts his 2016 campaign claims about being better for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans than his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Trump dodged the draft a total of five times, once arguing he couldn’t serve in the U.S. military because of bone spurs in his heels.</p>",President Trump tweeted Wednesday that the U.S. government will not allow transgender people “to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.”,"stunning <marker> the draft a total of five times, once arguing he couldn’t serve in the U.S. military because of bone spurs in<marker><marker> his heels<marker>Trump dodged the draft a total of five times, once arguing he couldn’t serve in the U.S. military because of bone spurs in his heels.<marker><marker>Trump dodged the draft a total of five times, once arguing he couldn’t serve in the U.S. military because of bone spurs in his heels.Click to View Full ArticleClick to View Republican Party Principles (if needed)<marker>dodged the <marker>",{},-2.5,0,0|5,-1.25,Left,Left,Left,Correct,acf1b79e-3649-4285-899c-a1e37018581a,,,,,,,,

U.S. Defense Department spokeswoman Dana White said the mission was to send North Korea a “clear message” Trump has “many military options to defeat any threat.”</p> <p>North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong-ho said on Monday that North Korea had the right to shoot down U.S. bombers in its airspace and Trump's statements were ""a declaration of war"" against the country.</p> <p>""Last week Trump claimed our leadership declared war on ... this is clearly a declaration of war on all members states,"" Ri said. ""The whole world should remember U.S. declared war on our people. The U.N. charter stipulates right of defense in charter.""</p> <p>""Since the U.S. declared war on our country, we have the right to shoot down U.S. bombers in our airspace,"" Ri said.</p> <p>""Since he made declaration of war, all options are on the operation table,"" he added.</p> <p>Trump and North Korea's war of threats escalated last week when Trump called Kim Jong Un a “rocket man [who] is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.” The president first debuted the nickname in a tweet days earlier, but made a firm stance against Kim and the hermit kingdom during his address to the United Nations General Assembly. He's since changed the nickname to ""little rocket man.""</p> <p>“North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life,” Trump said, vowing to “totally destroy” the dictatorship.</p> <p>WHY TRUMP'S ECONOMIC MOVES AGAINST NORTH KOREA MAY DO MORE TO TAME KIM THAN ANY INSULT</p> <p>Kim fired back by calling the president a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard” who had “denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world.”</p> <p>Both leaders have dubbed each other a “mad man."" On Saturday, Ri said Trump’s rhetoric makes a missile attack on “the entire U.S. mainland inevitable all the more.”</p> <p>""None other than Trump himself is on a suicide mission,"" Ri told the General Assembly on Saturday. ""In case innocent lives of the U.S. are lost because of this suicide attack, Trump will be held totally responsible.""</p> <p>Fox News' Ben Evansky and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>","Today, North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-ho told reporters outside the United Nations in New York that, ""since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to ... shoot down United States strategic bombers."" This statement came after a week of General Assembly meetings in New York in which Ri made a speech that referred to President Trump as a ""mentally deranged person full of megalomania."" Trump responded to the speech with a tweet that said the foreign minister and Kim Jong-un ""won't be around much longer.""",{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,Center,Right,NotByCenter,aecbc3cb-59c5-4e4e-8925-069abd8e1c15,,,,,,,,

The White House argued that the reduction is positive because it means Americans will forgo jobs or extra work to stay home with their children or strike out on their own as entrepreneurs. Republicans, however, said the report amounted to an “I told you so” moment and that subtracting the equivalent of 2 million workers can’t be good for the economy.</p> <p>The CBO said the number of workers dropping out of the labor force will grow from 2 million in 2017 to 2.5 million by 2024.</p> <p>Although part of those numbers are attributed to job cuts, the vast majority represent workers who decide it makes more sense to stay home or work fewer hours, weighing the higher taxes they pay in the workforce versus their qualifications for benefits if they drop out.</p> <p>“CBO estimates that the ACA will reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 to 2 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor — given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive,” the nonpartisan tax agency said in its economic outlook.</p> <p>The CBO also said the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges will enroll 6 million people by the first deadline in March, which is 1 million fewer than earlier projections. But by the end of the decade, the number of people without insurance coverage will have dropped from 45 million today to 30 million, the agency said in its annual update on the economic and budget outlook.</p> <p>Powered by spending cuts, higher taxes and a slowly improving economy, the federal deficit will drop to less than a half-trillion dollars next year but then begin a steady climb to more than $1 trillion a year by 2022, according to CBO projections.</p> <p>Slower recovery</p> <p>The CBO said the economic recovery from the deep recession from December 2007 to June 2009 is taking longer and won’t be as strong as previous recoveries. Analysts say the labor market’s fundamentals have shifted.</p> <p>Obamacare is one part of that because it rearranges incentives for businesses and workers.</p> <p>White House chief economic adviser Jason Furman said the health care law is about giving workers more choices. He compared it to Social Security and Medicare, which he said gave senior citizens the incentives and financial wherewithal to retire.</p> <p>In this case, he said, the CBO’s numbers show that the health care law will let younger workers make decisions about whether to remain in the workforce.</p> <p>“Maybe a spouse who wanted to be part-time so they could spend more time with their family now is able to do that,” Mr. Furman told reporters. “Somebody else who wanted to start a business and become an entrepreneur and was terrified of doing it because they’d lose their health insurance, is now able to do that too, and switch and take a chance on creating jobs and growing the overall economy. So there’s a lot of new choices that this will facilitate.”</p> <p>At the same time, Mr. Furman said he doesn’t agree with the CBO’s numbers. He argues that agency analysts didn’t take into account lower health care costs and higher worker productivity that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs a year.</p> <p>Republicans, though, used the jobs number to attack Senate Democrats seeking re-election in November.</p> <p>“This is one of the perverse incentives in this terrible law. It actually encourages able-bodied people to not work,” said Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican. “We should be doing all that we can to increase labor force participation. The health care law actually pushes it in the opposite direction.”</p> <p>Deficit progress</p> <p>Taking the budget as a whole, the CBO said Congress has made substantial headway on cutting spending and raising taxes, which will reduce the deficit to $514 billion this year and $478 billion in 2015.</p> <p>But it will rise by 2016 and steadily grow to more than $1 trillion in 2022.</p> <p>The CBO report said the economy isn’t rebounding as fast as is typical after a recession and that poor growth means less revenue for the Treasury. That means the cumulative deficit over the next decade will be $1 trillion more than projected last year.</p> <p>National debt, which is the accumulation of annual deficits, is at its highest level since the aftermath of World War II.

Republicans, however, said the report amounted to an “I told you so” moment and that subtracting the equivalent of 2 million workers can’t be good for the economy.</p> <p>The CBO said the number of workers dropping out of the labor force will grow from 2 million in 2017 to 2.5 million by 2024.</p> <p>Although part of those numbers are attributed to job cuts, the vast majority represent workers who decide it makes more sense to stay home or work fewer hours, weighing the higher taxes they pay in the workforce versus their qualifications for benefits if they drop out.</p> <p>“CBO estimates that the ACA will reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 to 2 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor — given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive,” the nonpartisan tax agency said in its economic outlook.</p> <p>The CBO also said the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges will enroll 6 million people by the first deadline in March, which is 1 million fewer than earlier projections. But by the end of the decade, the number of people without insurance coverage will have dropped from 45 million today to 30 million, the agency said in its annual update on the economic and budget outlook.</p> <p>Powered by spending cuts, higher taxes and a slowly improving economy, the federal deficit will drop to less than a half-trillion dollars next year but then begin a steady climb to more than $1 trillion a year by 2022, according to CBO projections.</p> <p>Slower recovery</p> <p>The CBO said the economic recovery from the deep recession from December 2007 to June 2009 is taking longer and won’t be as strong as previous recoveries. Analysts say the labor market’s fundamentals have shifted.</p> <p>Obamacare is one part of that because it rearranges incentives for businesses and workers.</p> <p>White House chief economic adviser Jason Furman said the health care law is about giving workers more choices. He compared it to Social Security and Medicare, which he said gave senior citizens the incentives and financial wherewithal to retire.</p> <p>In this case, he said, the CBO’s numbers show that the health care law will let younger workers make decisions about whether to remain in the workforce.</p> <p>“Maybe a spouse who wanted to be part-time so they could spend more time with their family now is able to do that,” Mr. Furman told reporters. “Somebody else who wanted to start a business and become an entrepreneur and was terrified of doing it because they’d lose their health insurance, is now able to do that too, and switch and take a chance on creating jobs and growing the overall economy. So there’s a lot of new choices that this will facilitate.”</p> <p>At the same time, Mr. Furman said he doesn’t agree with the CBO’s numbers. He argues that agency analysts didn’t take into account lower health care costs and higher worker productivity that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs a year.</p> <p>Republicans, though, used the jobs number to attack Senate Democrats seeking re-election in November.</p> <p>“This is one of the perverse incentives in this terrible law. It actually encourages able-bodied people to not work,” said Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican. “We should be doing all that we can to increase labor force participation. The health care law actually pushes it in the opposite direction.”</p> <p>Deficit progress</p> <p>Taking the budget as a whole, the CBO said Congress has made substantial headway on cutting spending and raising taxes, which will reduce the deficit to $514 billion this year and $478 billion in 2015.</p> <p>But it will rise by 2016 and steadily grow to more than $1 trillion in 2022.</p> <p>The CBO report said the economy isn’t rebounding as fast as is typical after a recession and that poor growth means less revenue for the Treasury. That means the cumulative deficit over the next decade will be $1 trillion more than projected last year.</p> <p>National debt, which is the accumulation of annual deficits, is at its highest level since the aftermath of World War II. The CBO said debt held by the public will represent 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2024, the end of the budget window.</p> <p>The report will give ammunition to those who argued that tax increases or spending cuts should have been delayed while the government pursued more economic stimulus over the past few years.</p> <p>But the CBO suggested that the problems are more structural, given the aging U.S. population and women’s participation in the labor force.</p> <p>The report said the labor market for the rest of this decade will recover more slowly than analysts predicted last year.</p> <p>The analysts said that at the deepest part of the recession, GDP was 7.5 percent below the economy’s potential output.

On Wednesday evening, The New York Times reported on two women who said they were groped by the real estate mogul ― one during a plane ride more than three decades ago, the other outside an elevator 11 years ago. Another woman told the Palm Beach Post that Trump grabbed her inappropriately 13 years ago. People magazine published a first-person account from writer Natasha Stoynoff detailing how Trump forced himself on her during an interview at his Mar-a-Lago estate.</p> <p>Trump denied those allegations at a rally on Thursday, accusing the press of trying to undermine his candidacy. “These events never, ever happened,” he said.</p> <p>His spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told HuffPost that Boyne’s story was a fabrication. “Mr. Trump never heard of this woman and would never do that,” Hicks said.</p> <p>Another woman who was at the dinner said she couldn’t recall Trump acting in that fashion. However, she did confirm that the dinner took place, acknowledged that Boyne was there and suggested that women were climbing atop tables that evening.</p> <p>Boyne’s allegations also echo the accounts of other Trump accusers, who have come forward since he was caught on a hot mic bragging about grabbing and kissing women without their consent.</p> <p>The incident she describes took place in the summer of 1996. At the time, Boyne was a 25-year-old think tank employee living in Manhattan who had become good friends with Sonja Morgan, then Sonja Tremont, and now a cast member on Bravo’s “Real Housewives of New York.”</p> <p>Lisa Boyne Lisa Boyne (left) pictured with Sonja Morgan, now a ""Real Housewives of New York"" cast member.</p> <p>One night that summer, Boyne said that Morgan, who was well-connected in New York’s elite social circles, invited her to dinner in Lower Manhattan with Trump and John Casablancas, the famed modeling agent who died in 2013. Trump and Morgan picked Boyne up at her apartment.</p> <p>According to Boyne, Trump dominated the conversation in the limo, boasting of his sexual conquests and rating their attractiveness.</p> <p>“He was constantly talking about himself, who he was dating, who he was sleeping with, who he was trying to sleep with,” Boyne said. “I just remember feeling very surprised and upset.”</p> <p>Once at the restaurant, the group met up with Casablancas, who had brought along five or six models. It quickly became clear to Boyne that this was an opportunity for Trump to meet young, attractive women. Months earlier, Trump’s then-wife Marla Maples had allegedly been caught sleeping with a bodyguard. (Trump and Maples would officially divorce in 1997.)</p> <p>According to Boyne, the group was seated at a semi-circular table, with the women in the middle and Trump and Casablancas flanking either end. The women couldn’t get out of their seats without one of the men getting up ― which they refused to do. Instead, Boyne said, Trump insisted that the women walk across the table, allowing him to peer up their skirts while they did so. Trump “stuck his head right underneath their skirts,” Boyne said, and commented on whether they were wearing underwear and what their genitalia looked like.</p> <p>Boyne said that Trump never made any such advance on her. “I’m not a model. He wasn’t interested in me,” she said. “He was more interested in my opinion of who I think he should sleep with. I remember that vividly.”</p> <p>Eventually, however, she insisted that the men let her leave her seat. She found a payphone at the restaurant to call her roommate. At her roommate’s suggestion, Boyne returned to the table, told the group she wasn’t feeling well and went home.</p> <p>Lisa Boyne Lisa Boyne (left) pictured with Sonja Morgan on a separate occasion.</p> <p>In an interview on Thursday, Morgan confirmed that the dinner took place and even named the restaurant― Raoul’s in the SoHo neighborhood of New York. She also confirmed that Trump, Casablancas and several models were in attendance, but she denied any lewd actions on Trump’s part.</p> <p>“I don’t remember any of that kind of behavior,” Morgan said. “But I have been known to dance on tables.”</p> <p>The roommate Boyne called, Karen Beatrice, said she never heard from Boyne that night, although she did not deny that a dinner took place. Beatrice, who described Boyne as a publicity seeker, added that she once worked as a model and had met Trump as well.</p> <p>“He was nothing but gracious and charming,” Beatrice recalled.</p> <p>Boyne said she was shocked by Beatrice’s refusal to confirm the incident and said Beatrice was one of the few people she had talked to about the incident over the years. She doesn’t recall ever talking to Morgan about that night.</p> <p>As for why she is coming forward now, Boyne said she experienced a “flashback” to that 1996 dinner when she saw a New York Times story in May detailing a number of disturbing stories of how Trump has interacted with women in private. When the 2005 recording of Trump boasting about sexual assault emerged last week, she felt compelled to share her story.</p> <p>“I met lots of famous, influential wealthy people with Sonja, and none of them were ever as vulgar, as disgusting, as rude, as sexist, such a low excuse for a human being that I’ve ever met.

On Wednesday evening, The New York Times reported on two women who said they were groped by the real estate mogul ― one during a plane ride more than three decades ago, the other outside an elevator 11 years ago. Another woman told the Palm Beach Post that Trump grabbed her inappropriately 13 years ago. People magazine published a first-person account from writer Natasha Stoynoff detailing how Trump forced himself on her during an interview at his Mar-a-Lago estate.</p> <p>Trump denied those allegations at a rally on Thursday, accusing the press of trying to undermine his candidacy. “These events never, ever happened,” he said.</p> <p>His spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told HuffPost that Boyne’s story was a fabrication. “Mr. Trump never heard of this woman and would never do that,” Hicks said.</p> <p>Another woman who was at the dinner said she couldn’t recall Trump acting in that fashion. However, she did confirm that the dinner took place, acknowledged that Boyne was there and suggested that women were climbing atop tables that evening.</p> <p>Boyne’s allegations also echo the accounts of other Trump accusers, who have come forward since he was caught on a hot mic bragging about grabbing and kissing women without their consent.</p> <p>The incident she describes took place in the summer of 1996. At the time, Boyne was a 25-year-old think tank employee living in Manhattan who had become good friends with Sonja Morgan, then Sonja Tremont, and now a cast member on Bravo’s “Real Housewives of New York.”</p> <p>Lisa Boyne Lisa Boyne (left) pictured with Sonja Morgan, now a ""Real Housewives of New York"" cast member.</p> <p>One night that summer, Boyne said that Morgan, who was well-connected in New York’s elite social circles, invited her to dinner in Lower Manhattan with Trump and John Casablancas, the famed modeling agent who died in 2013. Trump and Morgan picked Boyne up at her apartment.</p> <p>According to Boyne, Trump dominated the conversation in the limo, boasting of his sexual conquests and rating their attractiveness.</p> <p>“He was constantly talking about himself, who he was dating, who he was sleeping with, who he was trying to sleep with,” Boyne said. “I just remember feeling very surprised and upset.”</p> <p>Once at the restaurant, the group met up with Casablancas, who had brought along five or six models. It quickly became clear to Boyne that this was an opportunity for Trump to meet young, attractive women. Months earlier, Trump’s then-wife Marla Maples had allegedly been caught sleeping with a bodyguard. (Trump and Maples would officially divorce in 1997.)</p> <p>According to Boyne, the group was seated at a semi-circular table, with the women in the middle and Trump and Casablancas flanking either end. The women couldn’t get out of their seats without one of the men getting up ― which they refused to do. Instead, Boyne said, Trump insisted that the women walk across the table, allowing him to peer up their skirts while they did so. Trump “stuck his head right underneath their skirts,” Boyne said, and commented on whether they were wearing underwear and what their genitalia looked like.</p> <p>Boyne said that Trump never made any such advance on her. “I’m not a model. He wasn’t interested in me,” she said. “He was more interested in my opinion of who I think he should sleep with. I remember that vividly.”</p> <p>Eventually, however, she insisted that the men let her leave her seat. She found a payphone at the restaurant to call her roommate. At her roommate’s suggestion, Boyne returned to the table, told the group she wasn’t feeling well and went home.</p> <p>Lisa Boyne Lisa Boyne (left) pictured with Sonja Morgan on a separate occasion.</p> <p>In an interview on Thursday, Morgan confirmed that the dinner took place and even named the restaurant― Raoul’s in the SoHo neighborhood of New York. She also confirmed that Trump, Casablancas and several models were in attendance, but she denied any lewd actions on Trump’s part.</p> <p>“I don’t remember any of that kind of behavior,” Morgan said. “But I have been known to dance on tables.”</p> <p>The roommate Boyne called, Karen Beatrice, said she never heard from Boyne that night, although she did not deny that a dinner took place. Beatrice, who described Boyne as a publicity seeker, added that she once worked as a model and had met Trump as well.</p> <p>“He was nothing but gracious and charming,” Beatrice recalled.</p> <p>Boyne said she was shocked by Beatrice’s refusal to confirm the incident and said Beatrice was one of the few people she had talked to about the incident over the years. She doesn’t recall ever talking to Morgan about that night.</p> <p>As for why she is coming forward now, Boyne said she experienced a “flashback” to that 1996 dinner when she saw a New York Times story in May detailing a number of disturbing stories of how Trump has interacted with women in private. When the 2005 recording of Trump boasting about sexual assault emerged last week, she felt compelled to share her story.</p> <p>“I met lots of famous, influential wealthy people with Sonja, and none of them were ever as vulgar, as disgusting, as rude, as sexist, such a low excuse for a human being that I’ve ever met. I was so deeply offended, I felt that like with Bill Cosby, the more people that come forward, the more legitimacy the story will have,” Boyne said.</p> <p>“I find it hard to believe that he’s changed,” she added. “That was who he was. He was somebody who was interested in women as sex objects and their only merit was their beauty.”</p> <p>Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.</p>","Following the release of the 2005 taped comments made by Donald Trump, and his defense during the 2nd presidential debate that they were just ""locker room talk"", multiple women have come forth saying that he sexually assaulted them.","Yet another woman is alleging that she witnessed inappropriate sexual advances by Donald Trump, now the Republican nominee for president.<marker> Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.<marker>Yet another woman is alleging that she witnessed inappropriate sexual advances by Donald Trump, now the Republican nominee for president.<marker>",{},-5,0,0|5|4,-2.5,Left,Left,Left,Correct,b256eb0c-9e71-4d14-87db-1216be80a246,,,,,,,,

This is a lazy argument and should be quickly disregarded. Comparing transgender people to minorities is downright ridiculous.</p> <p>The United States military’s job is to be the most lethal force the world has ever seen. It is meant to fight, kill and defeat any enemy that might be stupid enough to cross America. So, the question is very simple. Do the actions of the few transgender people in the military out-weigh the distraction it’ll bring? The obvious answer is absolutely not.</p> <p>If our military’s readiness is delayed by a fraction of a second because military member’s are uncomfortable with transgender people, then it’s not worth it. Only a few days ago the Army was telling women to prepare to shower with “women” who had penises. If war broke out with Russia tomorrow, would we be better off because our female soldiers, Marines and sailors were having to mentally prepare to shower with “women” who had male genitals? I think the answer is an obvious no.</p> <p>Call me stupid, but I trust the opinion of Secretary of Defense Mattis more than I trust the opinion of a hack on Twitter who is complaining about this decision.</p> <p>I’m also not going to weigh in on whether or not being transgender is a mental illness. There are already plenty of people discussing that.</p> <p>All I have to say is that I couldn’t be happier with this choice. The military exists to defend this country, help our allies and kill any sorry son of a gun that desperately wants to head over to the afterlife. It doesn’t exist to push social narratives or test out experiments.</p> <p>Follow David on Twitter</p>",President Trump tweeted Wednesday that the U.S. government will not allow transgender people “to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.”,{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,Right,Right,Correct,b272b82d-9a03-404a-990c-f305dc8f3050,,,,,,,,

According to Elmendorf, that statistic is being taken out of context to suggest that Obamacare will eliminate jobs.</p> <p>“The reason we don’t use the term ‘lost jobs’ is there is a critical difference between people who like to work and can’t find a job — or have a job that’s lost for reasons beyond their control — and people who choose not to work,” he explained. “If someone comes up to you and says, ‘The boss says I’m being laid off because we don’t have enough business to pay,’ any other person feels bad about that and we sympathize for them having lost their job. If someone says, ‘I decided to retire or stay home and spend more time with my family and spend more time doing my hobby,’ they don’t feel bad about it — they feel good about it. And we don’t sympathize.

This directly contradicts the claims made Monday by House Speaker Brian Bosma (R) and Senate President Pro Tem David Long (R) that the legislation never had anything to do with discrimination.</p> <p>Eric Miller, Executive Director of Advance America, is another anti-LGBT activist who stood by Pence as he signed the bill. Advance America praised Pence for signing the bill last week, openly stating that it would allow wedding vendors to refuse to serve same-sex couples and allow Christian businesses to refuse transgender people access to restrooms. Miller was quoted as saying, “It is vitally important to protect religious freedom in Indiana. It’s the right thing to do. It was therefore important to pass Senate Bill 101 in 2015 in order to help protect churches, Christian businesses and individuals from those who want to punish them because of their Biblical beliefs!” Pence and Miller, it turns out, go way back.</p> <p>On the national stage, conservatives are similarly defending the RFRA and arguing it needs no fixing. Andrew Walker, Director of Policy Studies for the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, perhaps best summed up the distortion conservatives are using to argue that it’s not discriminatory:</p> <p>A wedding vendor who chooses not to service a same-sex wedding is not discriminating against a person’s being. Instead, the vendor believes that material cooperation in a particular event encroaches on his conscience… To give relief to a particular wedding vendor who feels uncomfortable servicing a gay wedding isn’t in any way comparable to state-sponsored discrimination… To require a wedding vendor to service a same-sex wedding is not eliminating discrimination against the gay couple. It’s coercing the wedding vendor.</p> <p>Walker is simultaneously admitting that the law is designed to allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people while denying that it’s actually “discrimination” that’s taking place. Radio host Bryan Fischer, formerly of the American Family Association, took the Christian self-victimization a step further. “This law is not something that provides for discrimination against gays,” he explained. “It is something that prevents discrimination against Christians… This thing is an anti-discrimination bill because it prohibits governmental discrimination against Christians in the state of Indiana.”</p> <p>The Heritage Institute’s Ryan T. Anderson used this messaging to try to take on Apple CEO Tim Cook, who wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post this week calling these so-called “religious freedom” laws dangerous. According to Anderson, “the only person in favor of discrimination in this debate is Tim Cook.” As one of his examples, Anderson claims, “It is Tim Cook who would have the government discriminate against these citizens, have the government coerce them into helping to celebrate a same-sex wedding and penalize them if they try to lead their lives in accordance with their faith.”</p> <p>Using as his example Washington florist Barronelle Stutzman — who was fined last week for refusing to serve a same-sex couple — Anderson reiterates the distortion: “This debate has nothing to do with refusing to serve gays simply because they’re gay, and this law wouldn’t protect that. But should the government force a 70-year-old grandmother to violate her beliefs? Should the government coerce her into helping to celebrate a same-sex wedding?” Anderson later highlights Aaron and Melissa Klein, bakery owners who also face fines for refusing service to a same-sex couple, as somehow another example of how RFRA is not about discrimination. He echoed these talking points on MSNBC last night as well, offering the caveat that nothing guarantees a vendor will win if they defend their discrimination with RFRA.</p> <p>The Family Research Council has been making the media rounds as well. In addition to defending Pence and the law on their website, both Tony Perkins and Peter Sprigg have taken to cable news this week to defend their positions. Sprigg went toe-to-toe with CNN’s Chris Cuomo Monday morning, where he acknowledged that wedding vendors trying to discriminate could use the law to defend themselves, but like Anderson, he tried to couch that in the idea that they wouldn’t necessarily win. The only thing these Christian wedding vendors object to, Sprigg suggested, “is using their expressive abilities to communicate a message that they disagree with by saying that marriage can be a union of two men or two women,” adding that it’s “forcing them to do something that violates their faith.”</p> <p>On Fox News Monday night, Perkins continued to falsely conflate Indiana’s RFRA with laws by the same name in other states, adding, “Let’s be very clear what RFRA is. This is a shield to protect one’s belief from government. It is not a sword to be used against anyone else and it cannot be… This is only a defense and it is not an iron-clad defense at that.” Perkins went on to describe the notion that some people want to “force people to engage in a behavior such as weddings — photographers, florists. In a civil society, what we would say is, ‘Oh, you don’t want to service me? Fine, I’ll go next store. I’ll go down the street.’” Borrowing a rather mockable talking point from Mike Huckabee, he added, “Who would fathom the idea of someone going into a Kosher deli and demanding a ham sandwich?”</p> <p>Despite conservatives all asserting that RFRA is designed to allow businesses to refuse to offer products and services to same-sex couples that they offer to others, Pence continued to defend the law as not being discriminatory in a Wall Street Journal op-ed posted Monday evening.

Some later huddled in the basement of the nearby Tropicana hotel-casino.</p> <p>Some officers took cover behind their vehicles while others carrying assault rifles ran into the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.</p> <p>Concertgoers said they initially thought the gunshots were firecrackers.</p> <p>This is the fourth time the country music festival was being held in Las Vegas and this year it was headlined by popular singers like Eric Church, Sam Hunt, Maren Morris, the Brothers Osborne, Lee Brice, Kane Brown, and Lauren Alaina, The Las Vegas Weekly reported.</p>","Many politicians, members of the media, and other public figures are offering condolences as well as opinions in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 58 dead and 500 others injured in Las Vegas Sunday night. Many people on the Left are calling for stricter gun legislation and for Congress to act quickly in response to the shooting. Conversely, many on the Right are saying that the event should not be politicized until all information has been acquired and the dust has settled.",{},{},0,0,6,0,Center,Center,Right,NotByCenter,b71fb6be-5524-4c37-84df-cb4e95d34f2b,,,,,,,,

Over the course of the campaign season, Trump has proven himself a liar of Clintonian proportions, and there has never been any reason to believe that he was somehow more trustworthy when it came to his rhetorical opposition to America’s foolish immigration policies — the ostensible raison d’être for his presidential campaign, one might recall. Moreover, the fact that he is more gold-obsessed than King Midas should have suggested otherwise.</p> <p>And, indeed, this turns out not to be the first time that Donald Trump has undermined American workers to expand his profit margin. That has been his M.O. throughout his career.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>In the early 1980s, Donald Trump was a thirtysomething real-estate up-and-comer embarking on what would, for a while, be the tallest all-glass structure in Manhattan, and what remains the centerpiece of the Trump architectural empire, his Vanity of Vanities: Trump Tower, on New York City’s Fifth Avenue. According to Barbara Res, the then-31-year-old who Trump selected to oversee Trump Tower’s construction, the Donald humbly referred to Trump Tower as “The Most Important Project in the World.”</p> <p>Apparently, the first leg of the project was too important to entrust to American workers. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Federal Court, members of House Wreckers Local 95 alleged that, to avoid paying union employees their pension and welfare benefits, Trump (and the contractor he used for the job, Kaszycki & Sons) brought in some 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish the Bonwit Teller building that then occupied the site of the future Trump Tower.</p> <p>RELATED: What if Trump Doesn’t Have Billions?</p> <p>Trump denied the claims, testifying that he only found out that undocumented workers were employed on the site long after the demolition. He demurred about even having visited the site. That turned out not to be true: “Testimony established that Donald Trump visited the 57th Street site and observed Kaszycki’s Polish workers, noting that they were ‘good hard workers,’” the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York wrote in its opinion in 1991. “Workers also observed Trump visiting the job site of the Bonwit Teller demolition job.” And it’s likely that he would have been able to distinguish between union and non-union workers: “The Polish workers were obvious not only in numbers but also in appearance. In contrast to the union workers the non-union, Polish workers were distinguished by the fact that most of them did not wear hard hats. In addition the Polish workers staged several very visible work stoppages because they were not being paid their wages.”</p> <p>Trump-owned companies have tried to import 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000.</p> <p>There were other good reasons to disbelieve Trump. Daniel J. Sullivan, a labor consultant and FBI informant who had advised Trump on the demolition, testified that Trump told him about undocumented workers at the site. Meanwhile, Thomas Macari, a vice president of Trump-Equitable and its manager in charge of the demolition of the Bonwit Teller Building, was on the site regularly. According to the court opinion, Macari “was involved in every aspect of the demolition job. He knew the Polish workers were working ‘off the books,’ that they were doing demolition work, that they were non-union, that they were paid substandard wages with no overtime pay, and that they were paid irregularly if at all.” And, as if that were not enough, Macari had interacted extensively with John Szabo, an immigration lawyer representing undocumented workers who were making claims for unpaid wages. In court, Szabo testified that a “John Barron” of the Trump organization had called him in 1980 and threatened a $100 million lawsuit if Szabo did not drop the undocumented workers’ claims — and Trump admitted that he and another of his executives sometimes used “John Barron” as an alias in business dealings. (As ex post facto confirmation of Szabo’s claim, consider that a) bullying inconvenient individuals is a go-to Trump tactic, and b) his son by his third wife, Melania, is “Barron William Trump.”)</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>RELATED: The Litigious — and Bullying — Mr. Trump</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The court ruled against Trump, finding that he and Kaszycki & Sons had “knowingly participated” in a scheme to get out of paying the union what it was owed. Trump won a partial victory on appeal, when the Second Circuit overturned part of the decision and referred the rest of it for “further proceedings.” But the available facts are hard to dispute.</p> <p>#share#Some three decades later, nothing has changed. Last year, the Washington Post reported that Trump is using undocumented workers in the construction work on his much-feted project to convert Washington, D.C.’s Old Post Office Pavilion into a luxury hotel. “Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally,” the Post’s Antonio Olivo wrote in July, “before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.”</p> <p>Donald Trump is not looking out for American workers. He is looking out for his own pocketbook.</p> <p>Trump’s executive vice president and legal counsel, Michael Cohen, “said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.” (Ahem? — see above.) He then pointed the finger at the contractor Trump has employed: “Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor. That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees’ status is accurate.” Of course, if history is any indication, just because Trump is employing a contractor does not mean he is unaware of the status of at least some of the workers.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Furthermore, it’s hard to imagine that Trump is utterly in the dark about his D.C. project. He apparently has spent days “beat[ing] up some contractors” employed in the development, as he boasted on Kelly Ripa’s radio show in January of last year. And he told Pat Robertson, during a visit to Regent University earlier this week, that his daughter, Ivanka, is spearheading the project, with help from his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric (the executive vice president and executive vice president, developments and acquisitions, of the Trump Organization, respectively).</p> <p>#related#And, of course, there is Trump’s use and abuse of America’s visa programs, beyond Mar-a-Lago. Reuters reviewed Department of Labor data last August, and reports that Trump-owned companies have tried to import 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000. Jobs “that Americans won’t do” include waitress, cook, vineyard worker, golf-course superintendent, hotel manager, banquet manager, and maid. Additionally, American women apparently are not attractive enough for Donald Trump; the Trump Model Management and Trump Management Group LLC have sought to import 250 fashion models from overseas.</p> <p>Conservative voters who believe that a President Trump will enforce and strengthen our immigration laws, will prosecute those who violate them, and will put the interest of American workers first are deluding themselves. Donald Trump’s professional history is one of undermining American workers — by exploiting the law wherever possible and, when that’s not enough, breaking it outright.

That has been his M.O. throughout his career.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>In the early 1980s, Donald Trump was a thirtysomething real-estate up-and-comer embarking on what would, for a while, be the tallest all-glass structure in Manhattan, and what remains the centerpiece of the Trump architectural empire, his Vanity of Vanities: Trump Tower, on New York City’s Fifth Avenue. According to Barbara Res, the then-31-year-old who Trump selected to oversee Trump Tower’s construction, the Donald humbly referred to Trump Tower as “The Most Important Project in the World.”</p> <p>Apparently, the first leg of the project was too important to entrust to American workers. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Federal Court, members of House Wreckers Local 95 alleged that, to avoid paying union employees their pension and welfare benefits, Trump (and the contractor he used for the job, Kaszycki & Sons) brought in some 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish the Bonwit Teller building that then occupied the site of the future Trump Tower.</p> <p>RELATED: What if Trump Doesn’t Have Billions?</p> <p>Trump denied the claims, testifying that he only found out that undocumented workers were employed on the site long after the demolition. He demurred about even having visited the site. That turned out not to be true: “Testimony established that Donald Trump visited the 57th Street site and observed Kaszycki’s Polish workers, noting that they were ‘good hard workers,’” the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York wrote in its opinion in 1991. “Workers also observed Trump visiting the job site of the Bonwit Teller demolition job.” And it’s likely that he would have been able to distinguish between union and non-union workers: “The Polish workers were obvious not only in numbers but also in appearance. In contrast to the union workers the non-union, Polish workers were distinguished by the fact that most of them did not wear hard hats. In addition the Polish workers staged several very visible work stoppages because they were not being paid their wages.”</p> <p>Trump-owned companies have tried to import 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000.</p> <p>There were other good reasons to disbelieve Trump. Daniel J. Sullivan, a labor consultant and FBI informant who had advised Trump on the demolition, testified that Trump told him about undocumented workers at the site. Meanwhile, Thomas Macari, a vice president of Trump-Equitable and its manager in charge of the demolition of the Bonwit Teller Building, was on the site regularly. According to the court opinion, Macari “was involved in every aspect of the demolition job. He knew the Polish workers were working ‘off the books,’ that they were doing demolition work, that they were non-union, that they were paid substandard wages with no overtime pay, and that they were paid irregularly if at all.” And, as if that were not enough, Macari had interacted extensively with John Szabo, an immigration lawyer representing undocumented workers who were making claims for unpaid wages. In court, Szabo testified that a “John Barron” of the Trump organization had called him in 1980 and threatened a $100 million lawsuit if Szabo did not drop the undocumented workers’ claims — and Trump admitted that he and another of his executives sometimes used “John Barron” as an alias in business dealings. (As ex post facto confirmation of Szabo’s claim, consider that a) bullying inconvenient individuals is a go-to Trump tactic, and b) his son by his third wife, Melania, is “Barron William Trump.”)</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>RELATED: The Litigious — and Bullying — Mr. Trump</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The court ruled against Trump, finding that he and Kaszycki & Sons had “knowingly participated” in a scheme to get out of paying the union what it was owed. Trump won a partial victory on appeal, when the Second Circuit overturned part of the decision and referred the rest of it for “further proceedings.” But the available facts are hard to dispute.</p> <p>#share#Some three decades later, nothing has changed. Last year, the Washington Post reported that Trump is using undocumented workers in the construction work on his much-feted project to convert Washington, D.C.’s Old Post Office Pavilion into a luxury hotel. “Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally,” the Post’s Antonio Olivo wrote in July, “before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.”</p> <p>Donald Trump is not looking out for American workers. He is looking out for his own pocketbook.</p> <p>Trump’s executive vice president and legal counsel, Michael Cohen, “said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.” (Ahem? — see above.) He then pointed the finger at the contractor Trump has employed: “Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor. That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees’ status is accurate.” Of course, if history is any indication, just because Trump is employing a contractor does not mean he is unaware of the status of at least some of the workers.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Furthermore, it’s hard to imagine that Trump is utterly in the dark about his D.C. project. He apparently has spent days “beat[ing] up some contractors” employed in the development, as he boasted on Kelly Ripa’s radio show in January of last year. And he told Pat Robertson, during a visit to Regent University earlier this week, that his daughter, Ivanka, is spearheading the project, with help from his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric (the executive vice president and executive vice president, developments and acquisitions, of the Trump Organization, respectively).</p> <p>#related#And, of course, there is Trump’s use and abuse of America’s visa programs, beyond Mar-a-Lago. Reuters reviewed Department of Labor data last August, and reports that Trump-owned companies have tried to import 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000. Jobs “that Americans won’t do” include waitress, cook, vineyard worker, golf-course superintendent, hotel manager, banquet manager, and maid. Additionally, American women apparently are not attractive enough for Donald Trump; the Trump Model Management and Trump Management Group LLC have sought to import 250 fashion models from overseas.</p> <p>Conservative voters who believe that a President Trump will enforce and strengthen our immigration laws, will prosecute those who violate them, and will put the interest of American workers first are deluding themselves. Donald Trump’s professional history is one of undermining American workers — by exploiting the law wherever possible and, when that’s not enough, breaking it outright. Donald Trump is not looking out for American workers. He is looking out for his own pocketbook. That’s not going to change by putting him in the White House.</p>",Rubio Unleashes On Trump,"Trump has proven himself a liar of Clintonian proportions,<marker>The news that Donald Trump turned down 94 percent of American job applicants to his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., in favor of foreign workers brought in under the H-2B visa program should come as a surprise to absolutely no one. <marker>Conservative voters who believe that a President Trump will enforce and strengthen our immigration laws, will prosecute those who violate them, and will put the interest of American workers first are deluding themselves. <marker>",{},-5,0,0|5,-2.5,Left,Left,Right,Not,b840383b-2266-48a1-bfef-91d652ec3f62,,,,,,,,

(After the Las Vegas shooting, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he has no plans to bring the silencer bill to the House floor for a vote, the Washington Post reported.)</p> <p>Trump responded saying, “We’ll talk about that later.”</p> <p>But despite taking a moderate position on gun control while a private citizen, President Trump has since become a staunch defender of the Second Amendment -- earning the endorsement of the National Rifle Association during the 2016 presidential election.</p> <p>“You came through big for me, and I am going to come through for you,” Trump said in April at the NRA’s convention.</p>","President Trump left Washington Wednesday morning en route to Las Vegas where he plans to meet with the victims, first responders and doctors caught up in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. But he is expected to steer clear of the gun control issue.","<marker>steer clear<marker><marker>will likely bypass the oportunity<marker><marker>was for certain sane, rational, limited aspects of gun control<marker><marker>despite taking a moderate position on gun control while a private citizen,<marker>",{},-5,-2.5,4,-3.75,Left,Left,Right,Not,b965e522-18e6-46ff-8d65-fee6a7ea48ec,,,,,,,,

Nikki Haley revealed Monday that the U.S. had to twist China and Russia’s arms to get them on board with the new sanctions on North Korea.</p> <p>North Korea conducted two tests of an intercontinental ballistic missile in July, escalating the military threat. Prior to this test, North Korea tested several new short-, medium-, and intermediate-range missiles. Pyongyang has developed an arsenal of ballistic missiles that it can use against its neighbors and the U.S. As North Korea is close to a viable nuclear deterrent, the U.S. pushed the U.N. Security Council to act, and that required convincing China and Russia.</p> <p>The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved Resolution 2371, the “the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime” and “the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation” over the weekend, according to Haley. The resolution is expected to reduce North Korea’s $3 billion export revenue by roughly one-third.</p> <p>“The international community is standing with one voice. China didn’t pull off. Russia didn’t pull off. And all of the Security Council and the international community said that’s enough,” Haley said to Fox News’ Dana Perino Monday evening. She explained that North Korea’s repeated provocations are trying the patience of the international community. “It’s reckless. It’s irresponsible. And the international community really laid down the groundwork of saying we’re not going to watch you do this anymore.”</p> <p>North Korea responded with its usual brand of aggression in the wake of the latest round of sanctions. North Korea will “make the U.S. pay dearly for all the heinous crime it commits against the state and people of this country,” North Korean state-media warned Monday. North Korea may also be moving anti-ship cruise missiles into place along its eastern shores, according to Fox News’ Lucas Tomlinson, citing military intelligence reports.</p> <p>“They’re going to threaten, … but we’re not going to run scared from them,” Haley explained.</p> <p>In response to the growing threat from North Korea, the Pentagon is working with counterparts in Seoul to give South Korean missiles a boost. South Korea wants heavier conventional warheads for its long-range missiles to ensure that they can adequately penetrate hardened North Korean defenses at a distance.</p> <p>“Our job is to defend not just the United States, but our allies,” Haley told Fox, adding, “We have to protect our friends, and we’re going to continue to do that.”</p> <p>As for sanctions, Haley explained that the U.S. will need to stay after China to ensure that they fully implement sanctions against their nuclear neighbor. “China stepped up and said, ‘We will follow through on these sanctions’,” she told Perino, “And now we have to just stay on them to make sure they do that.”</p> <p>The North Korea problem is one that has puzzled world leaders for decades, but now that the North possesses nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of striking targets in Northeast Asia and across the vast Pacific Ocean, the situation is even more complicated. The U.S. and its allies are praying for a diplomatic solution, recognizing that any sort of military solution would be catastrophic and, in the words of Secretary of Defense James Mattis, “tragic on an unbelievable scale.”</p> <p>The challenge is that North Korea believes its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles are essential for its survival, and it has said numerous times that it is unwilling to negotiate away its weapons, especially now that it is so close to a reliable nuclear deterrent.</p> <p>Follow Ryan on Twitter</p> <p>Send tips to [email protected] dailycallernewsfoundation.org.</p> <p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

That’s the strategy the Trump team tested on Thursday night after the candidate refused to say whether President Obama was born in the United States, even after several top surrogates reported that he’s rejected birtherism.</p> <p>During an interview conducted while Donald Trump’s private plane was idling on a tarmac, the Washington Post’s Robert Costa asked if Trump would finally admit that Obama was born in the United States. “I’ll answer that question at the right time,” Trump said. “I just don’t want to answer it yet.”</p> <p>Costa then asked if that means Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was wrong when she said last week that Trump now believes Obama was born in Hawaii. “It’s okay. She’s allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs. I want to focus on other things,” Trump said.</p> <p>Other Trump surrogates have tried to quash the birther controversy in the last week, with Mike Pence saying he “accepts” Obama’s birthplace, Rudy Giuliani falsely claiming that Trump rejected birtherism two years ago, and Ben Carson calling on Trump to apologize.</p> <p>Trump explained, once again, that he has simply decided not to discuss his years-long effort to delegitimize the first black president of the United States. “I don’t talk about it anymore. The reason I don’t is because then everyone is going to be talking about it as opposed to jobs, the military, the vets, security,” he told Costa.</p> <p>Many on Twitter speculated that Trump’s hesitance meant the master showman was waiting to renounce birtherism in a dramatic debate moment. Then the Trump campaign revealed that the “right time” was actually a few hours later on Thursday night.</p> <p>Full Trump campaign statement (note this is not from Trump himself but from communications director) pic.twitter.com/oLtXEiWaFe — James Pindell (@JamesPindell) September 16, 2016</p> <p>But upon further inspection, it’s campaign spokesman Jason Miller who’s disavowed birtherism, not Donald Trump. While the statement says “Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States,” there is no quote from the candidate clarifying his previous remarks. And while in a normal campaign you can assume that the candidate agrees with statements released by their campaign, that’s not the case with Trump. Allow him to explain:</p> <p>Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2016</p> <p>Furthermore, Miller’s statement contains multiple incorrect statements. First, it claims birtherism originated with Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign. Trump has made this accusation before, though both the Washington Post and Politifact concluded that while questions about Obama’s birthplace did originate with Clinton supporters, there is “no direct tie to Clinton or her 2008 campaign.”</p> <p>It’s interesting that the Trump campaign now characterizes birtherism as an “ugly incident,” but the assertion that Trump considered the case closed once Obama produced his birth certificate in 2011 is untrue.

That’s the strategy the Trump team tested on Thursday night after the candidate refused to say whether President Obama was born in the United States, even after several top surrogates reported that he’s rejected birtherism.</p> <p>During an interview conducted while Donald Trump’s private plane was idling on a tarmac, the Washington Post’s Robert Costa asked if Trump would finally admit that Obama was born in the United States. “I’ll answer that question at the right time,” Trump said. “I just don’t want to answer it yet.”</p> <p>Costa then asked if that means Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was wrong when she said last week that Trump now believes Obama was born in Hawaii. “It’s okay. She’s allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs. I want to focus on other things,” Trump said.</p> <p>Other Trump surrogates have tried to quash the birther controversy in the last week, with Mike Pence saying he “accepts” Obama’s birthplace, Rudy Giuliani falsely claiming that Trump rejected birtherism two years ago, and Ben Carson calling on Trump to apologize.</p> <p>Trump explained, once again, that he has simply decided not to discuss his years-long effort to delegitimize the first black president of the United States. “I don’t talk about it anymore. The reason I don’t is because then everyone is going to be talking about it as opposed to jobs, the military, the vets, security,” he told Costa.</p> <p>Many on Twitter speculated that Trump’s hesitance meant the master showman was waiting to renounce birtherism in a dramatic debate moment. Then the Trump campaign revealed that the “right time” was actually a few hours later on Thursday night.</p> <p>Full Trump campaign statement (note this is not from Trump himself but from communications director) pic.twitter.com/oLtXEiWaFe — James Pindell (@JamesPindell) September 16, 2016</p> <p>But upon further inspection, it’s campaign spokesman Jason Miller who’s disavowed birtherism, not Donald Trump. While the statement says “Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States,” there is no quote from the candidate clarifying his previous remarks. And while in a normal campaign you can assume that the candidate agrees with statements released by their campaign, that’s not the case with Trump. Allow him to explain:</p> <p>Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2016</p> <p>Furthermore, Miller’s statement contains multiple incorrect statements. First, it claims birtherism originated with Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign. Trump has made this accusation before, though both the Washington Post and Politifact concluded that while questions about Obama’s birthplace did originate with Clinton supporters, there is “no direct tie to Clinton or her 2008 campaign.”</p> <p>It’s interesting that the Trump campaign now characterizes birtherism as an “ugly incident,” but the assertion that Trump considered the case closed once Obama produced his birth certificate in 2011 is untrue. (And the idea that he did President Obama a favor is laughable.) Here’s Trump in 2012:</p> <p>When I was 18, people called me Donald Trump. When he was 18, @BarackObama was Barry Soweto.

Justice Stephen Breyer, an institutional pragmatist, seemed to seize on the case to portend the heavy lift that awaited the justice system in the years ahead: “There’s no blank check, even for the president,” he said during the hearing. “And if there’s no blank check, that means sometimes they can go too far. And if they have gone too far, it is our job to say that.”</p> <p>The tragedy of Trump’s “full pardon” of disgraced Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio is that there’s nothing anyone can do to check it. Certainly not the courts: The pardon is not only unconditional and irrevocable, but also an affront to judicial authority writ large — part and parcel of the president’s ongoing feud with federal judges who don’t rule as he’d like.</p> <p>The reason Arpaio’s reprieve is a slap in the face to the courts is that the crime originated in the courts. U.S. District Judge Murray Snow — a deeply conservative George W. Bush appointee who for years oversaw a civil case accusing the sheriff of trampling on Latinos’ constitutional rights — held him in contempt of court for doing precisely the thing he was being sued over. Snow had had it with Arpaio’s recalcitrance: He and his cronies “have demonstrated a persistent disregard for the orders of the Court, as well as an intention to violate and manipulate the laws and policies regulating their conduct,” he wrote in a contempt order last year.</p> <p>Arpaio’s trail of racist lawlessness is endless. But this was the first time that his disregard for the rule of law rose to the level of a criminal offense — Snow found his violations serious enough under federal law that he felt a referral to the Department of Justice was necessary. And once all was said and done, it was Trump’s own Justice Department that prosecuted Arpaio and scored a conviction against him before a different judge just last month. The evidence was conclusive: “Because the Court finds that Defendant willfully violated an order of the court, it finds Defendant guilty of criminal contempt.”</p> <p>None of that matters now. Trump’s pardon short-circuits the entire process: Arpaio hadn’t even been sentenced yet. The pardon effectively disrupts the work of career DOJ lawyers who were preparing for the sentencing phase; of court officers who were readying a pre-sentence report to guide the sentencing judge; of Arpaio’s own lawyers, who just last week filed court papers seeking to quash Arpaio’s conviction; of the judge who was due to sentence the sheriff in October. The wheels of justice ground to a halt simply because the nation’s chief executive said so. As with other matters that are still within the purview of prosecutors, like Bob Mueller’s inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice in the Russia probe, Trump is once again inserting himself in criminal proceedings that are yet to run their course. As one former White House counsel put it in Lawfare, “a pardon will have every appearance of being direct interference in the administration of justice.”</p> <p>Trump may very well believe that Arpaio was adjudged a convicted criminal simply for “doing his job,” as he told a cheerful crowd in Phoenix earlier this week. The two share a bond over rounding up bad hombres, after all, and then some. But no law-enforcement officer’s job description includes a carte blanche to violate constitutional rights, let alone flout court orders to stop doing so. On its own terms, the pardon flies in the face of Trump’s purported law-and-order presidency.</p> <p>Maybe Trump meant for the pardon to be interpreted as a reward for Arpaio’s faithful surrogacy during the presidential campaign. Maybe it’s a presidential show of gratitude for being the only ally with the “guts” to not give up on the birther crusade against President Obama. Or maybe Trump is simply being Trump — playing to his base by pardoning the unpardonable just because he can, and because it would drive the other side mad. “We polled the race stuff and it didn’t matter,” Stephen Bannon infamously told Joshua Green.

It is now fair game for Donald Trump to talk about you and his supporters to talk about you. You spoke at the Democratic Convention, which is a political platform.” (RELATED: Here’s How Capt. Khan Died)</p> <p>Khan replied, “Well, they have been exercising their rights so there is nothing new to that.” (RELATED: MSNBC: Pat Smith’s Speech Was ‘Offensive’ But Khizr Khan’s Was ‘Memorable’)</p> <p>“We are private citizens. We are private people. We want to be out of this controversy,” Khan said. “My good wife, Ghazala, had been insisting that I not to respond. I let — I take a more dignified path than responding to undignified attacks and comments. Therefore, we jointly decide that there is no need to escalate this. We have made the point.”</p> <p>Earlier in the CNN interview, when asked if he imagined that after his speech there would be controversy, Khan said, “No, I did not, neither my family. We are private people. We participated in this convention because a tribute was being paid.”</p> <p>During his speech at the DNC last week, Khan accused Trump of not sacrificing anything, also arguing, “If it was up to Donald Trump, [my son] never would have been in America. Donald Trump consistently smears the character of Muslims. He disrespects other minorities — women, judges, even his own party leadership. He vows to build walls and ban us from this country.”</p> <p>“Donald Trump, you are asking Americans to trust you with our future. Let me ask you: Have you even read the U.S. Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy.

So this may be just a matter of simple self-protection, and in that respect, it is probably a wise move. Pagliano’s lawyer is an experienced former prosecutor who knows the drill. With the FBI conducting some sort of investigation into possible criminal conduct, it is usually the small fish that is the first target. By not testifying, the problem may simply go away for him. If Congress or the FBI really wants his testimony, one or the other can give Pagliano immunity from using his testimony against him in prosecution. If they don’t, he can’t be compelled to testify. And by not testifying to Congress, Pagliano can’t lie to Congress or get caught in inconsistent statements, which is where his biggest potential for criminal exposure probably is. Many a felon has been convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, which prohibits false statements to the federal government as part of an official inquiry.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>But putting aside the wisdom of his decision, Pagliano’s invocation of the privilege certainly raises the question of whether there is criminal conduct in which his testimony might implicate him. Remember, this is the guy who helped set up her secret server while employed by her campaign. He later got a job in her State Department and may have played a role while there in maintaining the server. There’s not much reason, from what we know, to think he was involved in sending or receiving classified information. So the real concern is the server itself.</p> <p>Pagliano’s invocation of the privilege certainly raises the question of whether there is criminal conduct in which his testimony might implicate him.</p> <p>As we have noted from the beginning of this controversy, it is a felony for the custodian of a federal record (which Mrs. Clinton plainly was) to “willfully and unlawfully” conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify, or destroy the same (18 U.S.C. § 2071(b)). We don’t know all the facts here, but there certainly are indications that Mrs. Clinton set up this server for the purpose of evading federal disclosure and oversight. As James Carville argued back in March in trying to defend her, “I suspect she didn’t want [Congressman] Louie Gohmert riffling through her e-mails, which seems to me to be a kind of reasonable position for someone to take.” Reasonable only if she was not too concerned with complying with the law, perhaps.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#share#But why might this be relevant to Pagliano? Federal law also makes it a crime for any person to aid or abet another person’s commission of a crime. Pagliano can’t be principally liable for concealing or destroying records under Section 2071(b) because he wasn’t their custodian. But if he set up Mrs. Clinton’s server and assisted her in maintaining it knowing that the purpose was to avoid federal disclosure laws, he too might be implicated in criminal activity. That seems unlikely. More likely is that Pagliano is simply a techie who did what he was asked to do — set up a server. Again, we simply do not know all the facts here.</p> <p>#related#For Hillary Clinton, the bad news is more obvious. The optics of Pagliano’s decision are just terrible for her. This may not be a five-alarm fire, but there certainly is smoke coming from behind the walls. It becomes much more difficult to convince the public that there is nothing to see here when people start “taking five.” Whatever inferences can or can’t be drawn against Pagliano in a court of law, nothing will stop the public from drawing reasonable inferences against Hillary Clinton in the court of public opinion.</p> <p>— Shannen W.

Remember, this is the guy who helped set up her secret server while employed by her campaign. He later got a job in her State Department and may have played a role while there in maintaining the server. There’s not much reason, from what we know, to think he was involved in sending or receiving classified information. So the real concern is the server itself.</p> <p>Pagliano’s invocation of the privilege certainly raises the question of whether there is criminal conduct in which his testimony might implicate him.</p> <p>As we have noted from the beginning of this controversy, it is a felony for the custodian of a federal record (which Mrs. Clinton plainly was) to “willfully and unlawfully” conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify, or destroy the same (18 U.S.C. § 2071(b)). We don’t know all the facts here, but there certainly are indications that Mrs. Clinton set up this server for the purpose of evading federal disclosure and oversight. As James Carville argued back in March in trying to defend her, “I suspect she didn’t want [Congressman] Louie Gohmert riffling through her e-mails, which seems to me to be a kind of reasonable position for someone to take.” Reasonable only if she was not too concerned with complying with the law, perhaps.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#share#But why might this be relevant to Pagliano? Federal law also makes it a crime for any person to aid or abet another person’s commission of a crime. Pagliano can’t be principally liable for concealing or destroying records under Section 2071(b) because he wasn’t their custodian. But if he set up Mrs. Clinton’s server and assisted her in maintaining it knowing that the purpose was to avoid federal disclosure laws, he too might be implicated in criminal activity. That seems unlikely. More likely is that Pagliano is simply a techie who did what he was asked to do — set up a server. Again, we simply do not know all the facts here.</p> <p>#related#For Hillary Clinton, the bad news is more obvious. The optics of Pagliano’s decision are just terrible for her. This may not be a five-alarm fire, but there certainly is smoke coming from behind the walls. It becomes much more difficult to convince the public that there is nothing to see here when people start “taking five.” Whatever inferences can or can’t be drawn against Pagliano in a court of law, nothing will stop the public from drawing reasonable inferences against Hillary Clinton in the court of public opinion.</p> <p>— Shannen W.

The Republican chairman of the health committee said he’ll try to restart negotiations.</p> <p>Most in the GOP, though, were cool on the idea, saying the law is hopelessly flawed.</p> <p>“I think there are a number of them that are going to be very hesitant to try and put more money into a system that they are convinced is going south,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, South Dakota Republican.</p> <p>Without action, it will be up to President Trump to decide how aggressively to support the law as signups for 2018 begin.</p> <p>Republicans had been racing an end-of-month deadline to approve a repeal bill under the 2017 budget, which allowed them to avoid a Democratic filibuster.</p> <p>Some in the GOP insisted they can try again, either by writing a 2018 budget to accommodate repeal, or including it in the 2019 budget due early next year.</p> <p>But the 2018 budget is already being eyed to push through a tax reform package, and some Republicans were wary of loading it down with several big lifts.</p> <p>“The problem is, I don’t know that we can keep them separate, just to be frank,” Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the archconservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters at a Conversations with Conservatives event moderated by the Heritage Foundation.</p> <p>Rep. Thomas Massie, though, said Democrats packed multiple issues into the budget they used to help pass the Affordable Care Act originally, and said it could be done for repeal.</p> <p>“You could absolutely do two things in one,” the Kentucky Republican said. “It’s not dead on September 30th. Like many things here, it’s a fake deadline.”</p> <p>The House passed an Obamacare repeal bill in May, but the Senate has now failed three times.</p> <p>This latest attempt came on a bill from Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Under the plan, money that funded Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid and subsidized many of the people who bought plans on its exchanges would be pooled together and siphoned back to the states.</p> <p>Yet Sen.

It should have happened years ago,” the president said when announcing the terrorist designation for Mr. Kim’s “murderous regime.”</p> <p>“The North Korean regime must be lawful,” he said. “It must end its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile development, and cease all support for international terrorism — which it is not doing.”</p> <p>North Korea is one of four countries currently slapped with the State Department’s terror designation, joining Iran, Sudan and Syria.</p> <p>The Treasury is scheduled to announce the new sanctions Tuesday. The president, who just returned from a tour of East Asian capitals seeking to put new pressure on Pyongyang over its military programs, described those measures as the “highest level” yet imposed on North Korea.</p> <p>North Korea was designated a sponsor of terrorism for two decades after it was implicated in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed 115 people. President George W. Bush removed North Korea from the list in 2008 as part of an aid-for-disarmament deal.</p> <p>“That obviously failed because we can see where we are today,” Secretary of State Rex W.

The intelligence reports were also reportedly labeled a low classification level, so they would be accessible to more government workers — and some European allies.</p> <p>The Obama officials reportedly wanted to make sure that as many individuals — with the proper clearances — could see the intelligence. One of the tactics reportedly used was that officials asked pointed questions during intelligence briefings. The report said the answers to those questions are archived.</p> <p>Congressional staffers have said they are unaware of any evidence that materials related to Russia are not being preserved.</p> <p>But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said last week: ""There is real concern that some in the administration may try to cover up its ties to Russia by deleting emails, texts and other records that could shine a light on those connections. These records are likely to be the subject of executive branch as well as congressional investigations and must be preserved.""</p> <p>The Times report was released the same day that allegations emerged that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had two conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. during last year’s presidential campaign.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. investigators had examined contacts between Sessions and Russian officials and that the Justice Department was ""wringing its hands"" about how to proceed in the matter.</p> <p>The Journal also reported that Sessions did not know that his communications were under investigation.</p> <p>Reports about the meetings appeared to contradict a statement Sessions made during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general.</p> <p>Sessions was asked by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., how he would respond ""if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign.""When contacted by Fox News late Wednesday, Sessions said, ""I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.""</p> <p>Earlier this year, the FBI interviewed Michael Flynn, then Trump's national security adviser, about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Flynn was fired after it was revealed that he misled Vice President Pence and other White House officials about the nature of his discussions with the envoy.</p> <p>Trump, for his part, has denied that his campaign had any contact with Russian officials. The Times report pointed out that Trump has accused Obama officials with playing up the Russia story.</p> <p>“The only new piece of information that has come to light is that political appointees in the Obama administration have sought to create a false narrative to make an excuse for their own defeat in the election,” Sean Spicer, the current White House spokesman, said, according to The Times. “There continues to be no there, there.”</p> <p>The intelligence community has assessed that Russia's hacking of Democratic groups and operatives was carried out to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Trump has denied having any knowledge that aides were in touch with Russian intelligence agents during the election.</p>","Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice last year with the top Russian diplomat in Washington whose interactions with President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Flynn's firing.

The intelligence reports were also reportedly labeled a low classification level, so they would be accessible to more government workers — and some European allies.</p> <p>The Obama officials reportedly wanted to make sure that as many individuals — with the proper clearances — could see the intelligence. One of the tactics reportedly used was that officials asked pointed questions during intelligence briefings. The report said the answers to those questions are archived.</p> <p>Congressional staffers have said they are unaware of any evidence that materials related to Russia are not being preserved.</p> <p>But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said last week: ""There is real concern that some in the administration may try to cover up its ties to Russia by deleting emails, texts and other records that could shine a light on those connections. These records are likely to be the subject of executive branch as well as congressional investigations and must be preserved.""</p> <p>The Times report was released the same day that allegations emerged that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had two conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. during last year’s presidential campaign.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. investigators had examined contacts between Sessions and Russian officials and that the Justice Department was ""wringing its hands"" about how to proceed in the matter.</p> <p>The Journal also reported that Sessions did not know that his communications were under investigation.</p> <p>Reports about the meetings appeared to contradict a statement Sessions made during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general.</p> <p>Sessions was asked by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., how he would respond ""if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign.""When contacted by Fox News late Wednesday, Sessions said, ""I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.""</p> <p>Earlier this year, the FBI interviewed Michael Flynn, then Trump's national security adviser, about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Flynn was fired after it was revealed that he misled Vice President Pence and other White House officials about the nature of his discussions with the envoy.</p> <p>Trump, for his part, has denied that his campaign had any contact with Russian officials. The Times report pointed out that Trump has accused Obama officials with playing up the Russia story.</p> <p>“The only new piece of information that has come to light is that political appointees in the Obama administration have sought to create a false narrative to make an excuse for their own defeat in the election,” Sean Spicer, the current White House spokesman, said, according to The Times. “There continues to be no there, there.”</p> <p>The intelligence community has assessed that Russia's hacking of Democratic groups and operatives was carried out to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Trump has denied having any knowledge that aides were in touch with Russian intelligence agents during the election.</p>","Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice last year with the top Russian diplomat in Washington whose interactions with President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Flynn's firing.

It’s no surprise they’re frustrated.","<p>Photo: Mike Sullivan/Roseburg News-Review via AP</p> <p>As a shaken President Obama put it in his address Thursday night, the reaction to yesterday’s mass murder at Umpqua Community College has taken a sickeningly familiar course: “Somehow this has become routine,” he said. “The reporting is routine.

That was the story I hoped to write today: Knowing what we know about the impossibility of passing any significant gun-control legislation, at least given the current incarnation of Congress and the current strength of the National Rifle Association, what else can we do about mass shootings? How can we better predict them, in a behavioral sense?</p> <p>I reached out via email to Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a Columbia University psychiatrist who specializes in researching attacks like yesterday’s. He responded bluntly: “When I heard the news of the Oregon shootings, I thought, I’m done talking to reporters about the causes of violence.” Instead, he said he’d prepared a one-size-fits-all statement for the media that concluded, “If you tell me that there’s nothing we can do about guns, I’d say then we’re done. We’ve conceded that we are willing to tolerate periodic slaughters of the innocent. There’s nothing more to say.’”</p> <p>The problem, as he explained in a follow-up phone call, is that any attempt to predict who is most likely to commit a mass shooting — and therefore prevent it — runs up against the fact that these events are extremely rare, and as a result have only the broadest, least useful risk factors associated with them. (Mass shootings are generally defined as shootings in which four people or more die in a public place, and Appelbaum explained that stranger mass shootings like the one that occurred yesterday have somewhat different behavioral pathways as compared to multiple murders of, say, family members or co-workers, which are far more common events that don’t seize national attention quite as strongly as seemingly random ones.)</p> <p>The risk factors that are linked to these events — basically, being an angry young man — are so widespread in the population, he explained, and so weakly predictive of an individual actually committing a mass shooting as to be practically useless. “The answer is yes, at least of the most highly publicized, most fear-inducing cases of stranger shootings, by and large they are angry young men,” said Appelbaum. “But that doesn’t get you very far, because there are a lot of angry young men who are angry for all kinds of reasons, and unless one wants to lock them all up or put them all under 24-hour surveillance, it’s really impossible to build on a description that general to come up with effective preventative approaches.”</p> <p>Once you move past that incredibly broad category, he explained, “you’re really into murky territory where you’re identifying categories that some people fall into and others don’t,” he said. Take mental illness: While more and better-funded treatment for mental illness is obviously a good thing, Appelbaum said it just doesn’t have much of a direct connection to mass shootings. Sometimes mass shooters have a history of mental illness, but “[l]ots of people who commit mass killings are not mentally ill in any classical way,” Appelbaum said, noting that he wished Obama hadn’t mentioned mental illness in his address last night.</p> <p>Appelbaum also said he didn’t take cultural explanations for mass shootings all that seriously. “There have been commentators who have written for years about the peculiar violence-prone aspects of American culture, which they trace back to the frontier or even earlier.” These ideas “are interesting in a descriptive sense, but I don’t think they tell us much about what we should be doing about the problem. Because changing the influence of 400 years of American culture is even harder than doing something about reducing the number of guns in circulation.”</p> <p>As Appelbaum sees it, despite the endless, whirling conversations about the causes of mass shootings, there’s just no serious approach to the issues that doesn’t involve gun control. He mentioned that, despite widespread beliefs otherwise, there actually aren’t major differences between the overall rates of violence in the U.S. as compared to the rest of the developed world. Where the U.S. differs is in the number of homicides, and to Appelbaum that is largely attributable to the free flow of powerful guns. Every country has its angry young men; every country has various cultural forces that likely exacerbate violent people’s grievances; not every country makes it easy for anyone to get a gun. Some countries, like Australia, reacted forcefully to mass shootings by restricting the availability of powerful weaponry, and Appelbaum thinks the data is clear that these approaches work (Margaret Hartmann dug into the debate behind the Australian and British reactions to mass shootings Thursday).</p> <p>Appelbaum made it clear he didn’t see gun control as an instant panacea. “I don’t think anyone could say honestly that if we tighten up on the availability of guns and the ease of purchasing them, and reduce the number of weapons that are largely produced to kill large numbers of people, that the problem will go away completely,” he said. “I don’t think it will go away completely … there will be some people who will be able to get their hands on guns and be able to do horrible things with them. On the other hand, the harder we make it, logic and the Australian experience certainly suggest, the fewer such episodes there will be. So perfect safety is, I’m afraid, unobtainable in this world, but that doesn’t mean we can’t start making the situation better by just making it harder and having fewer guns in circulation.”</p> <p>The depressing thing about Appelbaum’s argument is that the underlying idea — we’ll likely never be able to predict who will commit a mass shooting — isn’t new to experts. He sent me to a Psychiatric Services article by a colleague, Dr. Jeffrey W. Swanson of Duke University, in which Swanson made the same points. “Profiles of mass killers suggest that they tend to be troubled young men,” he wrote in 2011. “This does not tell us which one of the very large population of troubled young men in the world will become the next mass killer; the vast majority of them will not.”</p> <p>Appelbaum and Swanson and other researchers, then, are forced to repeatedly re-debunk an idea that, in their minds, already has been shown to not make much sense — an idea that reporters and others grapple with only because a much simpler, more clear-cut solution has been deemed impossible for political reasons.

He sent me to a Psychiatric Services article by a colleague, Dr. Jeffrey W. Swanson of Duke University, in which Swanson made the same points. “Profiles of mass killers suggest that they tend to be troubled young men,” he wrote in 2011. “This does not tell us which one of the very large population of troubled young men in the world will become the next mass killer; the vast majority of them will not.”</p> <p>Appelbaum and Swanson and other researchers, then, are forced to repeatedly re-debunk an idea that, in their minds, already has been shown to not make much sense — an idea that reporters and others grapple with only because a much simpler, more clear-cut solution has been deemed impossible for political reasons.

We seized a moment, and as I said in that column , I think the pro-war side had the better argument at the time. But sometimes the better arguments turn out to be wrong when tested by reality. I subscribe to lots of might-have-been views on the war, and if it had been done right (assuming it could be), I wouldn’t have cared one whit about the WMD stuff. But the argument for toppling Saddam — from my point of view — was never that he was the greatest threat we face, but that he was the easiest target among various great threats. Iraq, obviously, has not turned out to be so easy (as a side note, I heard Ralph Peters on C-Span this morning making a very similar case). I’m a big supporter of the war on terror and I would like to think that even if we hadn’t gone to war in 2003, I would still have favored an aggressive policy toward Iraq.

My only point was that my view that the war was a mistake doesn’t necessarily require that my preference would be an Iraq with Saddam in power today. It’s possible, but certainly not my preferred position. Moreover, saying we should re-install Saddam simply isn’t remotely the same thing as saying we shouldn’t have deposed him the way we did. Just reverse it to see what I mean. If I wrote that all liberals who opposed the war really want to re-install Saddam, I’d get spammed from angry liberals for months.","Oh, one last point: Whatever I think about how we got into Iraq, the fact is we are there and a premature bug-out (er, “redeployment”) would be a disaster.","<p>Rich – That’s all fair.

Iraq, obviously, has not turned out to be so easy (as a side note, I heard Ralph Peters on C-Span this morning making a very similar case). I’m a big supporter of the war on terror and I would like to think that even if we hadn’t gone to war in 2003, I would still have favored an aggressive policy toward Iraq.

The new measure would fund the government through Dec. 15, essentially at last year’s levels, and would leave the budget sequester cuts in place.</p> <p>But Republicans on Friday also attached two amendments to the final bill — one to direct how government spending is prioritized in the event the Treasury Department bumps up against its borrowing limit in the coming weeks, and another that strips out funding for President Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act, which would effectively stop its implementation.</p> <p>“The American people don’t want the government shut down, and they don’t want Obamacare,” said House Speaker John A. Boehner, who rallied with fellow Republicans after the vote in a show of unity that seemed designed to quell speculation about a rebellion within the House Republican Conference.</p> <p>Republicans said the move was designed to put some Democratic senators on the spot. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor named several who are up for re-election next year, including Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu and Alaska Sen. Mark Begich.</p> <p>Democrats said the bill was an outrage that exposed Republicans’ true intention of trying to force a government shutdown.</p> <p>“It is a wolf in wolf’s clothing,” said Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. “Either you don’t know what you’re doing or this is one of the most intentional acts of brutality you’ve cooked up.”</p> <p>Rep. Nita Lowey, the top Democrat on the House spending committee, said limiting government funding now would immediate consequences, such as preventing federal authorities from being able to help out as Colorado recovers from devastating floods.</p> <p>Democrats urged the GOP to negotiate with them to raise taxes in order to spend more.</p> <p>Republicans countered that if they’d wanted to shut down government, they wouldn’t have brought any bill to the floor.</p> <p>“We are pragmatists.

The new measure would fund the government through Dec. 15, essentially at last year’s levels, and would leave the budget sequester cuts in place.</p> <p>But Republicans on Friday also attached two amendments to the final bill — one to direct how government spending is prioritized in the event the Treasury Department bumps up against its borrowing limit in the coming weeks, and another that strips out funding for President Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act, which would effectively stop its implementation.</p> <p>“The American people don’t want the government shut down, and they don’t want Obamacare,” said House Speaker John A. Boehner, who rallied with fellow Republicans after the vote in a show of unity that seemed designed to quell speculation about a rebellion within the House Republican Conference.</p> <p>Republicans said the move was designed to put some Democratic senators on the spot. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor named several who are up for re-election next year, including Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu and Alaska Sen. Mark Begich.</p> <p>Democrats said the bill was an outrage that exposed Republicans’ true intention of trying to force a government shutdown.</p> <p>“It is a wolf in wolf’s clothing,” said Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. “Either you don’t know what you’re doing or this is one of the most intentional acts of brutality you’ve cooked up.”</p> <p>Rep.

Today: Trump’s attacks on his attorney general, the Senate’s health-care vote, and new messaging from the Democrats.</p> <p>New White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci pledged to “fire everybody” to stop leaks to the press and almost immediately threatened Reince Priebus, implicitly accusing him of a felony. Meanwhile, the rift between Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggests Sessions may be out before long. What does Trump hope to gain from the purges in the highest reaches of his administration?</p> <p>At this juncture the priorities of Donald Trump have winnowed down to a single agenda item: saving himself and his family from legal culpability for their campaign interactions with the Russians and their efforts to cover up those transactions ever since. Almost everything this president does must be viewed through this single lens. If you do so, you’ll find his actions usually make sense.</p> <p>This overriding motive explains both this week’s orchestrated staff turmoil in the White House and the simultaneous assaults on the civil rights of transgender American troops and all LBGTQ employees in the private workplace. The primary purpose of all of it is to distract from investigations into potential Trump-family criminality and to galvanize a base that Trump believes will protect him against the rule of law. If you have already forgotten Jared Kushner’s loophole-strewn profession of innocence from Monday, that’s the point.</p> <p>It would seem particularly counterintuitive for Trump to go after the like-minded Sessions, who was not only the first sitting senator to endorse his campaign but whose Department of Justice has just filed the court papers seeking to cripple federal civil-rights law to roll back protections for employees based on sexual orientation. Sessions also shares Trump’s xenophobic opposition to immigration and his antediluvian approach to criminal justice. What’s more, Session’s political allies are Trump’s allies — from conservative Republican senators like Richard Shelby and Orrin Hatch to media cheerleaders like Breitbart and Tucker Carlson. But all of that is negated by Trump’s sole priority of derailing the Russian investigation. Trump assumed that Sessions would fix the investigation on his behalf, much as he expected corruptible local officials to fix his legal violations as a real-estate developer, and was appalled that Sessions’s recusal made that impossible. If Sessions survives, it will be only because Trump finds an easier way to achieve his No. 1 goal, the firing of Robert Mueller. That’s bound to happen no matter who stands in the way.</p> <p>Scaramucci’s inevitable humiliation will be entertaining to watch.</p> <p>As for Scaramucci, he may profess to know and love Trump, but clearly he doesn’t understand him. If he did, he’d know that his days are already as numbered as Sean Spicer’s were. Trump is a diva who doesn’t like anyone else to share his spotlight, and Scaramucci is a drama queen who seems determined to pull focus from his boss at any opportunity. He just can’t help himself. Scaramucci wasn’t even supposed to start officially as White House director of communications until August 15 and already he is overexposed. His inevitable sadomasochistic humiliation at the hands of the man he “loves” will be nothing if not entertaining to watch.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the departures and purges, this White House’s Nights of the Short Knives, will continue. The secretaries of Defense and State, Jim Mattis and Rex Tillerson, often considered the adults in the cabinet, are now castrated, serving as at best bystanders to major policy decisions. (Mattis, typically, was given only one day’s notice about the transgender troop ban.) The only Trump appointees whose jobs are safe are Ivanka and Jared. Trump is in the bunker now. The president no doubt feels that he could pull out a gun and shoot his attorney general on Fifth Avenue, and his base would still remain loyal. I have no doubt he’s correct: This is the same quarter of the populace that believes it makes sense to endanger themselves by replacing Obamacare with a wish and a prayer — the same crowd that believes transgender patriots serving their country in uniform, not Russians who hacked our election, are a clear and present danger to American security.</p> <p>Following his dramatic return to the Senate after brain surgery in Arizona, John McCain delivered a fiery lecture about the “obligation to work collectively” and voted to move the Obamacare repeal process forward. Will the rest of the health-care debate be worth the trip?</p> <p>If, as seems likely, the farcical GOP attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare ends in tragedy for millions of Americans deprived of health care, McCain’s trip to Washington will be a sad endnote to his career. With the notable exception of Donald Trump, most Americans deeply admire McCain’s courage as a prisoner of war and wish him a victory in his tough battle against cancer. Few can disagree with his speech this week chastising our bankrupt and inert Congress. But his actual vote in the Senate — to bail out Trump and Mitch McConnell in their desperate last-ditch bid to steamroll a cruel bill — directly contradicted his rhetorical sentiments that the Senate address health care through “regular order” in an open, bipartisan process instead of “behind closed doors.” McCain’s heroism in Vietnam exemplifies the maxim that actions speak louder than words. His vote this week in Washington belied his words, and were all too typical of his historic failure to stand up to Trump forcefully in the two years since he ridiculed McCain’s wartime service. That capitulation to the crazies on the right is not a recent aberration: It was, after all, his cynical choice to put Sarah Palin potentially within a heartbeat of the presidency almost a decade ago that prepared the ground for Trump.</p> <p>Only 25 percent of Americans support the Republican health-care bill — whatever it is — according to a poll aggregation by the MIT political scientist Chris Warshaw. That 25 percent — i.e., the hard-core Trump base — includes many of the Americans most likely to be victimized by it. They will ignore the “fake news” telling them so and believe the president when he blames Obama and the Democrats for their medical indignities. But few others will buy Trump’s passing of that buck. The GOP has owned American health care from the moment Trump held that premature Rose Garden “Mission Accomplished” celebration of the passage of the House bill. The GOP will also own whatever comes next: the Senate’s “skinny repeal” or whatever bastard legislation may emerge from a compromise between House and Senate Republicans in conference. While it will be of little solace to those Americans who lose their insurance or find their premiums and deductibles skyrocketing, the price to be paid by Republicans on the ballot in 2018 will be commensurately catastrophic.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Democratic leaders rolled out their “A Better Deal” agenda, an early effort to rebrand the party for 2018. What have they learned from the failures of last November?</p> <p>Little, if anything. One of the biggest lessons that the Democrats should have learned from Trump’s victories over bland GOP opponents like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio as well as Hillary Clinton is that his off-the-rails fulminations, however offensive or dishonest, have rendered typically anodyne political “messaging” (the word itself is offensive) obsolete. The boilerplate cobbled together by consultants, focus groups, and party committees sounds like the cautious pandering it is. One can only imagine the high-level discussion that went into the too-clever-by-half rubric “A Better Deal,” which is as much a surrender to Trump’s “Art of the Deal” jargon as a jab at it and which sounds like a dime-store New Deal besides.</p> <p>The boilerplate cobbled together by consultants, focus groups, and party committees sounds like the cautious pandering it is.</p> <p>Reading Chuck Schumer’s explanation of what this deal is in his Times op-ed, one can see the game immediately: The “Better Deal” Democrats aren’t going to offer an encyclopedia of planks as Hillary did (there are only three); they are not going to bring up gender or social issues or name-check minorities in the Democratic coalition (as Hillary did); and they are going to sound some populist notes (as Bernie Sanders and Trump did). But it’s populism lite: There’s nothing in this “Better Deal” to suggest that Democratic Establishment leaders like Schumer are going to abandon the corporate and Wall Street elites who have defined the party’s economic profile since Bill Clinton turned the Treasury Department over to Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers — the cadre that most recently could be found paying Hillary Clinton those self-immolating speaking fees.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi was honest when she said “A Better Deal” was not intended as “a course correction” but “a presentation correction.” Yet even that isn’t entirely the case: Though Schumer describes the Democrats’ manifesto as offering “bold changes” and “a new vision for our party,” much of its overall tone and substance is same-old, overlapping with what Schumer proposed in the book he published before the 2008 campaign, Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time.</p> <p>The recent Washington Post–ABC News poll finding that only 37 percent of Americans think that the Democratic Party “stands for something” — or, at best, “just stands against Trump” (52 percent) — rings true to me.

What does Trump hope to gain from the purges in the highest reaches of his administration?</p> <p>At this juncture the priorities of Donald Trump have winnowed down to a single agenda item: saving himself and his family from legal culpability for their campaign interactions with the Russians and their efforts to cover up those transactions ever since. Almost everything this president does must be viewed through this single lens. If you do so, you’ll find his actions usually make sense.</p> <p>This overriding motive explains both this week’s orchestrated staff turmoil in the White House and the simultaneous assaults on the civil rights of transgender American troops and all LBGTQ employees in the private workplace. The primary purpose of all of it is to distract from investigations into potential Trump-family criminality and to galvanize a base that Trump believes will protect him against the rule of law. If you have already forgotten Jared Kushner’s loophole-strewn profession of innocence from Monday, that’s the point.</p> <p>It would seem particularly counterintuitive for Trump to go after the like-minded Sessions, who was not only the first sitting senator to endorse his campaign but whose Department of Justice has just filed the court papers seeking to cripple federal civil-rights law to roll back protections for employees based on sexual orientation. Sessions also shares Trump’s xenophobic opposition to immigration and his antediluvian approach to criminal justice. What’s more, Session’s political allies are Trump’s allies — from conservative Republican senators like Richard Shelby and Orrin Hatch to media cheerleaders like Breitbart and Tucker Carlson. But all of that is negated by Trump’s sole priority of derailing the Russian investigation. Trump assumed that Sessions would fix the investigation on his behalf, much as he expected corruptible local officials to fix his legal violations as a real-estate developer, and was appalled that Sessions’s recusal made that impossible. If Sessions survives, it will be only because Trump finds an easier way to achieve his No. 1 goal, the firing of Robert Mueller. That’s bound to happen no matter who stands in the way.</p> <p>Scaramucci’s inevitable humiliation will be entertaining to watch.</p> <p>As for Scaramucci, he may profess to know and love Trump, but clearly he doesn’t understand him. If he did, he’d know that his days are already as numbered as Sean Spicer’s were. Trump is a diva who doesn’t like anyone else to share his spotlight, and Scaramucci is a drama queen who seems determined to pull focus from his boss at any opportunity. He just can’t help himself. Scaramucci wasn’t even supposed to start officially as White House director of communications until August 15 and already he is overexposed. His inevitable sadomasochistic humiliation at the hands of the man he “loves” will be nothing if not entertaining to watch.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the departures and purges, this White House’s Nights of the Short Knives, will continue. The secretaries of Defense and State, Jim Mattis and Rex Tillerson, often considered the adults in the cabinet, are now castrated, serving as at best bystanders to major policy decisions. (Mattis, typically, was given only one day’s notice about the transgender troop ban.) The only Trump appointees whose jobs are safe are Ivanka and Jared. Trump is in the bunker now. The president no doubt feels that he could pull out a gun and shoot his attorney general on Fifth Avenue, and his base would still remain loyal. I have no doubt he’s correct: This is the same quarter of the populace that believes it makes sense to endanger themselves by replacing Obamacare with a wish and a prayer — the same crowd that believes transgender patriots serving their country in uniform, not Russians who hacked our election, are a clear and present danger to American security.</p> <p>Following his dramatic return to the Senate after brain surgery in Arizona, John McCain delivered a fiery lecture about the “obligation to work collectively” and voted to move the Obamacare repeal process forward. Will the rest of the health-care debate be worth the trip?</p> <p>If, as seems likely, the farcical GOP attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare ends in tragedy for millions of Americans deprived of health care, McCain’s trip to Washington will be a sad endnote to his career. With the notable exception of Donald Trump, most Americans deeply admire McCain’s courage as a prisoner of war and wish him a victory in his tough battle against cancer. Few can disagree with his speech this week chastising our bankrupt and inert Congress. But his actual vote in the Senate — to bail out Trump and Mitch McConnell in their desperate last-ditch bid to steamroll a cruel bill — directly contradicted his rhetorical sentiments that the Senate address health care through “regular order” in an open, bipartisan process instead of “behind closed doors.” McCain’s heroism in Vietnam exemplifies the maxim that actions speak louder than words. His vote this week in Washington belied his words, and were all too typical of his historic failure to stand up to Trump forcefully in the two years since he ridiculed McCain’s wartime service. That capitulation to the crazies on the right is not a recent aberration: It was, after all, his cynical choice to put Sarah Palin potentially within a heartbeat of the presidency almost a decade ago that prepared the ground for Trump.</p> <p>Only 25 percent of Americans support the Republican health-care bill — whatever it is — according to a poll aggregation by the MIT political scientist Chris Warshaw. That 25 percent — i.e., the hard-core Trump base — includes many of the Americans most likely to be victimized by it. They will ignore the “fake news” telling them so and believe the president when he blames Obama and the Democrats for their medical indignities. But few others will buy Trump’s passing of that buck. The GOP has owned American health care from the moment Trump held that premature Rose Garden “Mission Accomplished” celebration of the passage of the House bill. The GOP will also own whatever comes next: the Senate’s “skinny repeal” or whatever bastard legislation may emerge from a compromise between House and Senate Republicans in conference. While it will be of little solace to those Americans who lose their insurance or find their premiums and deductibles skyrocketing, the price to be paid by Republicans on the ballot in 2018 will be commensurately catastrophic.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Democratic leaders rolled out their “A Better Deal” agenda, an early effort to rebrand the party for 2018. What have they learned from the failures of last November?</p> <p>Little, if anything. One of the biggest lessons that the Democrats should have learned from Trump’s victories over bland GOP opponents like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio as well as Hillary Clinton is that his off-the-rails fulminations, however offensive or dishonest, have rendered typically anodyne political “messaging” (the word itself is offensive) obsolete. The boilerplate cobbled together by consultants, focus groups, and party committees sounds like the cautious pandering it is. One can only imagine the high-level discussion that went into the too-clever-by-half rubric “A Better Deal,” which is as much a surrender to Trump’s “Art of the Deal” jargon as a jab at it and which sounds like a dime-store New Deal besides.</p> <p>The boilerplate cobbled together by consultants, focus groups, and party committees sounds like the cautious pandering it is.</p> <p>Reading Chuck Schumer’s explanation of what this deal is in his Times op-ed, one can see the game immediately: The “Better Deal” Democrats aren’t going to offer an encyclopedia of planks as Hillary did (there are only three); they are not going to bring up gender or social issues or name-check minorities in the Democratic coalition (as Hillary did); and they are going to sound some populist notes (as Bernie Sanders and Trump did). But it’s populism lite: There’s nothing in this “Better Deal” to suggest that Democratic Establishment leaders like Schumer are going to abandon the corporate and Wall Street elites who have defined the party’s economic profile since Bill Clinton turned the Treasury Department over to Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers — the cadre that most recently could be found paying Hillary Clinton those self-immolating speaking fees.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi was honest when she said “A Better Deal” was not intended as “a course correction” but “a presentation correction.” Yet even that isn’t entirely the case: Though Schumer describes the Democrats’ manifesto as offering “bold changes” and “a new vision for our party,” much of its overall tone and substance is same-old, overlapping with what Schumer proposed in the book he published before the 2008 campaign, Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time.</p> <p>The recent Washington Post–ABC News poll finding that only 37 percent of Americans think that the Democratic Party “stands for something” — or, at best, “just stands against Trump” (52 percent) — rings true to me. The Democrats will inevitably rebound after Trump’s implosion as they did after Richard Nixon’s, but, as was the case in the short-lived Jimmy Carter interregnum of the 1970s, the party’s comeback will prove short-lived if there is not a blood transfusion of new leaders and genuinely “bold” ideas.</p>","Anthony Scaramucci, President Trump's new director of communications, calls out ""Senior Leakers"" in the White House.","justice.

(Reuters photo: Jonathan Ernst)",There’s less to the news than meets the eye.,"The Manafort Indictment: Not Much There, and a Boon for Trump","<p>Michael Flynn arrives at a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., December 1, 2017. (Reuters photo: Jonathan Ernst)</p> <p>There’s less to the news than meets the eye.</p> <p>Former Trump-administration national-security adviser Michael Flynn is expected to plead guilty today to lying to the FBI regarding his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.</p> <p>Flynn, who is reportedly cooperating with the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller, is pleading guilty in federal district court in Washington, D.C., to a one-count criminal information (which is filed by a prosecutor in cases when a defendant waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury).</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The false-statement charge, brought under Section 1001 of the federal penal code, stems from Flynn’s conversation on December 29, 2016, with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. At the time, Flynn was slated to become the national-security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump. The conversation occurred on the same day that then-president Barack Obama announced sanctions against Russia for its interference in the 2016 election. It is believed to have been recorded by the FBI because Kislyak, as an agent of a foreign power, was subject to monitoring under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).</p> <p>Mueller has charged Flynn with falsely telling FBI agents that he did not ask the ambassador “to refrain from escalating the situation” in response to the sanctions. In being questioned by the agents on January 24, 2017, Flynn also lied when he claimed he could not recall a subsequent conversation with Kislyak, in which the ambassador told Flynn that the Putin regime had “chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of [Flynn’s] request.”</p> <p>Furthermore, a week before the sanctions were imposed, Flynn had also spoken to Kislyak, asking the ambassador to delay or defeat a vote on a pending United Nations resolution. The criminal information charges that Flynn lied to the FBI by denying both that he’d made this request and that he’d spoken afterward with Kislyak about Russia’s response to it.</p> <p>Thus, in all, four lies are specified in the one count. The potential sentence is zero to five years’ imprisonment. Assuming Flynn cooperates fully with Mueller’s investigators, there will be little, if any, jail time.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Obviously, it was wrong of Flynn to give the FBI false information; he could, after all, have simply refused to speak with the agents in the first place. That said, as I argued early this year, it remains unclear why the Obama Justice Department chose to investigate Flynn. There was nothing wrong with the incoming national-security adviser’s having meetings with foreign counterparts or discussing such matters as the sanctions in those meetings. Plus, if the FBI had FISA recordings of Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak, there was no need to ask Flynn what the conversations entailed.</p> <p>Flynn, an early backer of Donald Trump and a fierce critic of Obama’s national-security policies, was generally despised by Obama administration officials. Hence, there has always been cynical suspicion that the decision to interview him was driven by the expectation that he would provide the FBI with an account inconsistent with the recorded conversation — i.e., that Flynn was being set up for prosecution on a process crime.</p> <p>While initial reporting is portraying Flynn’s guilty plea as a major breakthrough in Mueller’s investigation of potential Trump campaign collusion with the Russian regime, I suspect the opposite is true.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>While initial reporting is portraying Flynn’s guilty plea as a major breakthrough in Mueller’s investigation of potential Trump-campaign collusion with the Russian regime, I suspect the opposite is true.</p> <p>Speculation that Flynn is now cooperating in Mueller’s investigation stirred in recent days due to reports that Flynn had pulled out of a joint defense agreement (or “common interest” arrangement) to share information with other subjects of the investigation. As an ethical matter, it is inappropriate for an attorney whose client is cooperating with the government (or having negotiations toward that end) to continue strategizing with, and having quasi-privileged communications with, other subjects of the investigation and their counsel.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Nevertheless, as I explained in connection with George Papadopoulos (who also pled guilty in Mueller’s investigation for lying to the FBI), when a prosecutor has a cooperator who was an accomplice in a major criminal scheme, the cooperator is made to plead guilty to the scheme. This is critical because it proves the existence of the scheme. In his guilty-plea allocution (the part of a plea proceeding in which the defendant admits what he did that makes him guilty), the accomplice explains the scheme and the actions taken by himself and his co-conspirators to carry it out. This goes a long way toward proving the case against all of the subjects of the investigation.</p> <p>That is not happening in Flynn’s situation. Instead, like Papadopoulos, he is being permitted to plead guilty to a mere process crime. A breaking report from ABC News indicates that Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians — initially to lay the groundwork for mutual efforts against ISIS in Syria. That, however, is exactly the sort of thing the incoming national-security adviser is supposed to do in a transition phase between administrations. If it were part of the basis for a “collusion” case arising out of Russia’s election meddling, then Flynn would not be pleading guilty to a process crime — he’d be pleading guilty to an espionage conspiracy.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Understand: If Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador had evinced the existence of a quid pro quo collusion arrangement — that the Trump administration would ease or eliminate sanctions on Russia as a payback for Russia’s cyber-espionage against the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic party — it would have been completely appropriate, even urgently necessary, for the Obama Justice Department to investigate Flynn.

(Reuters photo: Jonathan Ernst)",There’s less to the news than meets the eye.,"The Manafort Indictment: Not Much There, and a Boon for Trump","<p>Michael Flynn arrives at a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., December 1, 2017. (Reuters photo: Jonathan Ernst)</p> <p>There’s less to the news than meets the eye.</p> <p>Former Trump-administration national-security adviser Michael Flynn is expected to plead guilty today to lying to the FBI regarding his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.</p> <p>Flynn, who is reportedly cooperating with the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller, is pleading guilty in federal district court in Washington, D.C., to a one-count criminal information (which is filed by a prosecutor in cases when a defendant waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury).</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The false-statement charge, brought under Section 1001 of the federal penal code, stems from Flynn’s conversation on December 29, 2016, with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. At the time, Flynn was slated to become the national-security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump. The conversation occurred on the same day that then-president Barack Obama announced sanctions against Russia for its interference in the 2016 election. It is believed to have been recorded by the FBI because Kislyak, as an agent of a foreign power, was subject to monitoring under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).</p> <p>Mueller has charged Flynn with falsely telling FBI agents that he did not ask the ambassador “to refrain from escalating the situation” in response to the sanctions. In being questioned by the agents on January 24, 2017, Flynn also lied when he claimed he could not recall a subsequent conversation with Kislyak, in which the ambassador told Flynn that the Putin regime had “chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of [Flynn’s] request.”</p> <p>Furthermore, a week before the sanctions were imposed, Flynn had also spoken to Kislyak, asking the ambassador to delay or defeat a vote on a pending United Nations resolution. The criminal information charges that Flynn lied to the FBI by denying both that he’d made this request and that he’d spoken afterward with Kislyak about Russia’s response to it.</p> <p>Thus, in all, four lies are specified in the one count. The potential sentence is zero to five years’ imprisonment. Assuming Flynn cooperates fully with Mueller’s investigators, there will be little, if any, jail time.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Obviously, it was wrong of Flynn to give the FBI false information; he could, after all, have simply refused to speak with the agents in the first place. That said, as I argued early this year, it remains unclear why the Obama Justice Department chose to investigate Flynn. There was nothing wrong with the incoming national-security adviser’s having meetings with foreign counterparts or discussing such matters as the sanctions in those meetings. Plus, if the FBI had FISA recordings of Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak, there was no need to ask Flynn what the conversations entailed.</p> <p>Flynn, an early backer of Donald Trump and a fierce critic of Obama’s national-security policies, was generally despised by Obama administration officials. Hence, there has always been cynical suspicion that the decision to interview him was driven by the expectation that he would provide the FBI with an account inconsistent with the recorded conversation — i.e., that Flynn was being set up for prosecution on a process crime.</p> <p>While initial reporting is portraying Flynn’s guilty plea as a major breakthrough in Mueller’s investigation of potential Trump campaign collusion with the Russian regime, I suspect the opposite is true.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>While initial reporting is portraying Flynn’s guilty plea as a major breakthrough in Mueller’s investigation of potential Trump-campaign collusion with the Russian regime, I suspect the opposite is true.</p> <p>Speculation that Flynn is now cooperating in Mueller’s investigation stirred in recent days due to reports that Flynn had pulled out of a joint defense agreement (or “common interest” arrangement) to share information with other subjects of the investigation. As an ethical matter, it is inappropriate for an attorney whose client is cooperating with the government (or having negotiations toward that end) to continue strategizing with, and having quasi-privileged communications with, other subjects of the investigation and their counsel.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Nevertheless, as I explained in connection with George Papadopoulos (who also pled guilty in Mueller’s investigation for lying to the FBI), when a prosecutor has a cooperator who was an accomplice in a major criminal scheme, the cooperator is made to plead guilty to the scheme. This is critical because it proves the existence of the scheme. In his guilty-plea allocution (the part of a plea proceeding in which the defendant admits what he did that makes him guilty), the accomplice explains the scheme and the actions taken by himself and his co-conspirators to carry it out. This goes a long way toward proving the case against all of the subjects of the investigation.</p> <p>That is not happening in Flynn’s situation. Instead, like Papadopoulos, he is being permitted to plead guilty to a mere process crime. A breaking report from ABC News indicates that Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians — initially to lay the groundwork for mutual efforts against ISIS in Syria. That, however, is exactly the sort of thing the incoming national-security adviser is supposed to do in a transition phase between administrations. If it were part of the basis for a “collusion” case arising out of Russia’s election meddling, then Flynn would not be pleading guilty to a process crime — he’d be pleading guilty to an espionage conspiracy.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Understand: If Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador had evinced the existence of a quid pro quo collusion arrangement — that the Trump administration would ease or eliminate sanctions on Russia as a payback for Russia’s cyber-espionage against the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic party — it would have been completely appropriate, even urgently necessary, for the Obama Justice Department to investigate Flynn. But if that had happened, Mueller would not be permitting Flynn to settle the case with a single count of lying to FBI agents. Instead, we would be looking at a major conspiracy indictment, and Flynn would be made to plead to far more serious offenses if he wanted a deal — cooperation in exchange for sentencing leniency.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>To the contrary, for all the furor, we have a small-potatoes plea in Flynn’s case — just as we did in Papadopoulos’s case, despite extensive “collusion” evidence. Meanwhile, the only major case Mueller has brought, against former Trump-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an associate, has nothing to do with the 2016 election.

The release of nearly 20,000 emails is the first in a WikiLeaks “Hillary Leaks” series. (RELATED: Leaked Emails Show DNC Officials Constructing Anti-Bernie Narrative)</p> <p>Do You Think The DNC Is Corrupt? Yes No Login with your social identity to vote Thanks for participating in this survey, in order to vote you must register with your email address.</p> <p>Sign out.</p> <p>On April 29, a DNC press staffer, Rachel Palermo, alerted Eric Walker, deputy communications director, about a Facebook page for an anti-Trump protest on May 2 in South Bend. “Whoo! Thanks to our interns for finding this out.” Walker replies, “I like it, as long as the students feel safe getting involved. I imagine this demo will be nicer than the one in San Fran today.”</p> <p>That day in San Francisco protesters blocked off roads to an event Donald Trump was hosting. The Republican nominee ended up having to jump down from the highway and sneak around back to enter.</p> <p>In another other email chain also on April 29, titled “Week-Ahead Notes & Assignments,” former DNC media booker Pablo Manriquez comments “this should be fun” in reference to the May protest.</p> <p>University of Notre Dame, located in South Bend, is Manriquez’s alma mater. A DNC official wrote, “Pablo please reach out to any folks you think may be able to help.”</p> <p>Another protest that’s directly mentioned in emails included one that occurred on May 26 in Billings, MT. The email is from May 20 and features notes on the “week ahead.” (RELATED: ‘Sexist Pig’ And Other Eye-Opening Revelations In The DNC Email Leak)</p> <p>Both the Indiana and Montana protests were non-violent. The South Bend protest had “some expletive laced chants,” and protesters carrying Mexican flags. The Montana one had “only a few” protesters.</p> <p>Intern involvement with protests is mentioned twice in the leaked emails. DNC communications director Luis Miranda bemoaned photos of an empty anti-Trump protest in Washington, D.C. in one email chain.</p> <p>Miranda said: “Going forward, when our allies screw up and don’t deliver bodies in time, we either send all our interns out there or we stay away from it.. we don’t want to own a bad picture.”</p> <p>Miranda was notified of the Washington protest in an email chain titled “Tv coverage of protest great.” In the original email that notified the DNC communications director of the Indiana protest, a DNC staffer wrote, “thanks to our interns for finding this out.”</p> <p>DNC officials Brad Marshall, a chief financial officer, and Alan Reed, a compliance officer, also signed off on the use of Black Lives Matter organizer Deray Mckesson as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Mckesson rose to prominence after being active in protests in Ferguson, MO and Baltimore, MD. He has yet to endorse a candidate and said protests are likely to happen at the upcoming Democratic Party convention.</p>",Email leak from the DNC shows that they might have suppressed Bernie's chance at the nomination.,{},{},2.5,2.5,4,2.5,Right,Right,Right,Correct,fc9f1eda-940f-4f98-a115-4a2ee00d3826,,,,,,,,
