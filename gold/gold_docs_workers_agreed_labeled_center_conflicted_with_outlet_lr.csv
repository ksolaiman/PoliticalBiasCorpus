010d924f-4636-45ce-a97e-703055a109ad,Mark Levin may have prompted IRS-conservative group revelations,IRS Apologizes,"<p>Conservative radio talker Mark Levin appears to have touched off the investigation into Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative political groups back in March 2012.</p> <p>In a letter last year on behalf of the Landmark Legal Foundation, an organization he heads, Levin requested an investigation into what he called âmisconduct.â</p> <p>On Friday, the Internal Revenue Service revealed that it had improperly targeted conservative groups for audits during the 2012 election. During a conference call, Lois Lerner, the IRSâs director of exempt organizations, explained that IRS staffers selected groups that included the words âtea partyâ or âpatriotâ in their applications for tax exempt status.</p> <p>Levin told The Daily Caller Friday afternoon his organization had litigated similar complaints of political audits during the Clinton administration and specifically referenced the Heritage Foundation as one of the tax collectorâs targets at the time.</p> <p>More recently, Levin said, conservative and Tea Party groups approached him complaining of harassment by the IRS, which prompted his organization to petition Treasury Department Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George.</p> <p>âSo what happened here is we were contacted by a number of individuals with Tea Party affiliations and they were telling us what was going on,â he said. âThey were sharing the information with us and we concluded the best way to handle this was to go to the Treasury Department â the inspector generalâs office because the IRS per se we didnât think would conduct a thorough investigation of itself.â</p> <p>After that initial contact, Levin said two agents from Treasury paid his office a visit seeking more information.</p>",Center,Right
01cf769b-136c-483d-8e7f-d59e6a7b4dbe,"Las Vegas shooter's father, 'Bingo Bruce,' lived colorful life of crime and deception","Many politicians, members of the media, and other public figures are offering condolences as well as opinions in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 58 dead and 500 others injured in Las Vegas Sunday night. Many people on the Left are calling for stricter gun legislation and for Congress to act quickly in response to the shooting. Conversely, many on the Right are saying that the event should not be politicized until all information has been acquired and the dust has settled.","<p>The father of the gunman behind the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history robbed a string of banks in Arizona, escaped prison in Texas and tried to start a new life as the manager of a bingo parlor in Oregon, according to historical newspaper articles.</p> <p>Eric, the brother of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock, who killed at least 59 people from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino late Sunday, told the Orlando Sentinel that their father was Benjamin Hoskins Paddock.</p> <p>The elder Paddock, born in Wisconsin in 1926, had a host of other fake names and nicknames, including âBig Daddyâ and âOld Baldy,"" and was on the FBIâs Top Ten Most Wanted list from 1969 to 1977.</p> <p>Paddock was indicted in 1960 on three counts of robbing Phoenix branches of Valley National Bank, the Arizona Republic reported on Oct. 6 that year. He was accused of stealing close to $25,000 and was caught in the summer of 1960 by FBI agents in Las Vegas.</p> <p>""The FBI said Paddock tried to resist arrest and attempted to run down an agent with his car,"" read a July 28, 1960, report from the Tuscon Daily Citizen.</p> <p>The 6-foot-4, 245-pound Paddock was convicted and slapped with a 20-year prison sentence, but the lengthy jail term was cut short when he busted out of a federal prison in Texas in 1969, the Eugene Register-Guard reported.</p> <p>STEPHEN PADDOCK: WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT LAS VEGAS SHOOTING SUSPECT</p> <p>An escaped federal prisoner poster issued by the FBI at the time said Paddock was âdiagnosed as psychopathicâ and âreportedly has suicidal tendencies and should be considered armed and dangerous.â</p> <p>About six months after the escape, Paddock was involved in an armed robbery at a bank in San Francisco and in September 1978, he was awaiting trial related to charges from that incident, according to the Oregon newspaper.</p> <p>âMy view is let him goâ¦ and good riddance.â - Circuit Judge George Woodrich on Benjamin Hoskins Paddock's legal saga</p> <p>Paddock, described by the FBI as being an âavid bridge player,â had managed to live a secret life centered on another game --bingo -- as a parlor manager in Springfield, Ore.</p> <p>The FBI said Paddock lived for years in the Eugene-Springfield area under the alias of Bruce Werner Ericksen and managed to stay one step ahead of law enforcement by constantly changing his appearance and avoiding contact with police, which may have resulted in fingerprinting, the Eugene Register-Guard reported.</p> <p>The man dubbed by the newspaper as âBingo Bruceâ appeared to have run out of luck in 1978 when he was arrested, but the feds paroled him and he was back in the number-calling game just a year later.</p> <p>âHe was a nice guy, and helped a lot of people financially and did one hell of a lot for the kids,â former Junction City Mayor Chuck Ivey, who was on the parole board, told the newspaper.</p> <p>âAll that stuff is old news,â Ivey said when he asked about Paddockâs past.</p> <p>LAS VEGAS SHOOTING: TRUMP CALLS MASSACRE 'PURE ACT OF EVIL'</p> <p>In 1987, the gig finally ended when the Oregon Attorney Generalâs Office filed seven racketeering charges against Paddock related to his bingo operation. On top of that, he was charged with rolling back car odometers.</p> <p>Paddock settled the racketeering charges for $623,000 and pleaded no contest to the odometer case, while simultaneously claiming he had cancer.</p> <p>Among his other life claims: being an auto crew racing chief, Chicago Bears football player and survivor of a World War II mine sweeper sinking, according to the Eugene Register-Guard.</p> <p>When the final verdict in Paddockâs legal saga came in, and Circuit Judge George Woodrich decided to let him off with a $100,000 fine and no jail time.</p> <p>âHe could be conning everybody, but this is an economic crime and heâs an old man,â the newspaper quoted Woodrich as saying. âMy view is let him goâ¦ and good riddance.â</p> <p>Paddock then went back to the Lone Star state and lived there until his death in 1998. Laurel Paulson, a woman he met while living in Oregon, told the Eugene Register-Guard that he got by on a VA pension and helped her run a machine shop.</p> <p>âHe was a man that people either loved or hated,â she said. âHe always said he was a dinosaur.â</p>",Center,Right
0294a28d-68cd-4001-857e-f1656a4b3495,Sanders Campaign Sues DNC For Shutting Off Access To Voter File,DNC Disciplines Sanders Campaign,"<p>The Bernie Sanders presidential campaign is suing the Democratic National Committee over the partyâs decision on Thursday to revoke the campaign access to data maintained in its national voter file.</p> <p>In a complaint filed in federal court late Friday, the Sanders camp claims that the DNC failed to give proper notice before suspending access to the file â a move which the campaign says will cost it at least $600,000 a day in lost donations.</p> <p>The suspension has touched off a long-simmering battle between the Sanders campaign and the DNC. Sanders supporters, as well as those of former Maryland Gov. Martin OâMalley, have claimed that the party is doing everything it can to ensure that Hillary Clinton wins the party nomination.</p> <p>The partyâs refusal to hold more debates â as well as its scheduling of a debate for Saturday, a week before Christmas â is seen as evidence that the DNC and its chairwoman, Florida Rep. [crscore]Debbie Wasserman Schultz[/crscore], are in the tank for Clinton.</p> <p>The DNC announced that it was suspending the Sanders campaignâs access to the national voter file a day after several Sanders staffers accessed voter information that was accidentally released by NGP VAN, a third-party vendor that maintains a database of Democratic voters.</p> <p>According to CNN, the Sanders staffers conducted searches of the database that could yield useful information about potential voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and other crucial primary states.</p> <p>Two searches which were conducted included: âShow me all the Clinton people rated higher than 60â and âShow me all the people rated less than 30.â Such a search would allow the Sanders campaign to pinpoint which voters they would solicit for support â ignoring those who gave Clinton a high rating.</p> <p>But the Sanders campaign claims that in suspending its access to the file, the DNCâs move violated an agreement between the two parties. The complaint also pins blame for the data leak on the DNC and on NGP VAN.</p> <p>The complaint cites the two partiesâ Oct. 26 agreement, which states:</p> <p>Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event that the other party breaches this Agreement; the non-breaching party sends written notice to the breaching party describing the breach; and the breaching party does not cure the breach to the satisfaction of the non-breaching party within ten (10) calendar days following its receipt of such notice.</p> <p>The Sanders campaign claims that the agreement âdoes not permit either Party to terminate or suspend the Agreement without notice, or without providing the breaching Party with the requisite opportunity to cure.â</p> <p>According to the complaint, on Wednesday morning, NGP VAN released a modification of the voter data file which contained a bug âthat allowed the Campaign and other presidential candidates to view Confidential Information disclosed by competing campaigns.â</p> <p>The bug was resolved within four hours, but four Sanders campaign staffers had by then viewed confidential voter information for Hillary Clintonâs presidential campaign.</p> <p>The campaign claims that the staffers who viewed the information were not able to save or copy it because of restrictions in place on the NGP VAN software. The complaint also asserts that âmost of the staffersâ viewed the information âinadvertently.â</p> <p>After the bug was brought to the attention of senior Sanders campaign staffers, an internal investigation was conducted which revealed that one staffer âmay have repeatedly accessed Disclosed Information.â</p> <p>The staffer, Josh Uretsky, was fired on Thursday. He said in interviews that he and the other staffers were not trying to download the data, but merely hoped to find out what was causing the data breach.</p> <p>âThe Campaign should not be punished for the carelessness of the DNC and its third-party vendor,â the complaint reads.</p> <p>The voter file provides crucial campaign information, the complaint reads. The campaign stands to lose at least $600,000 per day in lost contributions.</p> <p>âHowever the damage to the Campaignâs political viability, as a result of being unable to communicate with constituents and voters, is far more severe, and incapable of measurement,â it states.</p> <p>Follow Chuck on Twitter</p>",Center,Right
091773c9-9457-4534-b764-d19057a39204,0-4 and an About-Face: Democrats Suddenly Believe Ossoff No Longer Matters,The result left President Trump and other Republicans crowing and Democrats shaking their heads.,"<p>He was a candidate on whom it would be worth risking millions. He was a messianic, baby-faced neophyte slated to stage a Macron-esque takeover of Georgiaâs sixth congressional district in the #Resistanceâs first great blow to Trumpâs America. CNNâs Don Lemon even likened him to Barack Obama.</p> <p>Jon Ossoff was supposed to be a vessel for the categorical repudiation of the Trump administration, but alas, as the president gleefully noted this morning, the Democrats marked two new entries in a growing line of losing streaks in special elections framed by some in the media as referendums on one of the most unpopular presidents in modern American history.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>After sinking $25 million into Ossoffâs campaign, Democrats are stuck rewriting the narrative that all hope and glory rested on the fate of GA-06.</p> <p>The original liberal logic went: An effective Democratic candidate, not bogged down by the scandals and unlikability of Hillary Clinton and running, in effect, against Trump (who beat Clinton in the district by an uncharacteristically low margin of 1.5 percent), could easily outperform Clinton. The Democrats put so much weight on this concept that Ossoffâs campaign became the most expensive congressional bid in U.S. history. California donors and super PACs outspent every other state nine-to-one to try to flip the sixth district, only to see Ossoff actually underperforming both the polls and Clintonâs 2016 GA-06 vote to go down in a stunning defeat.</p> <p>In April, Slate branded Ossoff the pioneer of âGeorgiaâs progressive renaissanceâ â a man gearing up to answer the âexistential insult of Trump.â Following Ossoffâs win in the Georgia primary, CNNâs Sally Kohn boasted that the election âdamn sure was a referendum on Trump and Trump lost big league.â The Left continued to characterize the race as Ossoff versus Trump as the runoff drew nearer. Just this past weekend, the New York Times declared it would be a âhigh-stakes referendum on Trump,â with the âhighestâ stakes for Republicans.</p> <p>Yet as the votes poured in and Handel began to exceed polling and expectations, the media began to sing a different tune.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The spin began as the New York Times tweeted that âHandel averted a humiliating upset for Republicans.â</p> <p>Voxâs Matthew Yglesias, who had previously compared Ossoffâs crusade to âBarack Obamaâs 2008 campaignâ reflective of a âleftward shift of the Democratic Partyâs message,â today decried his âbland and inoffensiveâ image of âjust a nice guy who doesnât like Donald Trump.â</p> <p>In a similar 180, Kohn tweeted out, âIn many ways, [Handel] distanced herself from [Trump]. This is not Trumpâs victory.â</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Wait, so is Ossoff basically Barack Obama or a tepid centrist? Is Handel a Trump surrogate or a Never Trumper? Most importantly, wasnât Ossoff supposed to win with a five-point lead?</p> <p>The Democratic panic is warranted. Ossoffâs losing 1.2 percent of Clintonâs GA-6 vote after the Democratic party put everything, emotionally and financially, on the line for a candidate they equated to their only remaining widely liked leader, has worrisome implications. Perhaps if the Democrats had put slightly less of a moral investment in this election, it would be seen for what it really is: a special election. But FiveThirtyEightâs Nate Silver aptly noted, âSometimes dumb things matter if everyone agrees that they matter.â</p> <p>With taxpayer-subsidized Planned Parenthood dumping nearly $735,000 into Ossoffâs campaign and the DCCC pouring in over $5 million, Republicans turned out to vote in record numbers. Ultimately, for Georgia voters the election was less of a referendum on Trump than a rejection of an untried carpetbagger.</p>",Center,Right
0caa1b6e-2ee6-46d3-8b6a-de381cfe10a3,Paul Ryan Address: Convention Speech Built On Demonstrably Misleading Assertions,Ryan RNC Speech,"<p>TAMPA, Fla. -- Paul Ryan pledged Wednesday that if he and his running mate Mitt Romney were elected president, they would usher in an ethic of responsibility. The Wisconsin congressman and GOP vice presidential candidate repeatedly chided President Barack Obama for blaming the jobs and housing crises on his predecessor, saying that his habit of ""forever shifting blame to the last administration, is getting old. The man assumed office almost four years ago -â isnât it about time he assumed responsibility?""</p> <p>Ryan then noted that Obama, while campaigning for president, promised that a GM plant in Wisconsin would not shut down. ""That plant didnât last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And thatâs how it is in so many towns today, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight,"" Ryan said.</p> <p>Except Obama didn't promise that. And the plant closed in December 2008 -- while George W. Bush was president.</p> <p>It was just one of several striking and demonstrably misleading elements of Ryan's much-anticipated acceptance speech. And it comes just days after Romney pollster Neil Newhouse warned, defending the campaign's demonstrably false ads claiming Obama removed work requirements from welfare, ""We're not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.""</p> <p>Ryan, for his part, slammed the president for not supporting a deficit commission report without mentioning that he himself had voted against it, helping to kill it.</p> <p>He also made a cornerstone of his argument the claim that Obama ""funneled"" $716 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare. But he didn't mention that his own budget plan relies on those very same savings.</p> <p>Ryan also put responsibility for Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. government debt at Obama's doorstep. But he didn't mention that S&P itself, in explaining its downgrade, referred to the debt ceiling standoff. That process of raising the debt ceiling was only politicized in the last Congress, driven by House Republicans, led in the charge by Paul Ryan.</p> <p>The credit rater also said it worried that Republicans would never agree to tax increases. âWe have changed our assumption on [revenue] because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues,â S&P wrote.</p> <p>Jodie Layton, a convention goer from Utah watching the Ryan speech, said she was blown away by the vice presidential candidate. But she said she was surprised to hear that after his speech about taking responsibility, he'd pinned a Bush-era plant closing on Obama.</p> <p>""It closed in December 2008?"" she asked, making sure she heard a HuffPost reporter's question right. After a long pause, she said, ""It's happening a lot on both sides. It's to be expected.""</p> <p>Ryan has referenced the GM plant before, and his attack was debunked by the Detroit News, which called it inaccurate. ""In fact, Obama made no such promise and the plant halted production in December 2008, when President George W. Bush was in office,"" Detroit News reporter David Sherpardson wrote earlier this month. ""Obama did speak at the plant in February 2008, and suggested that a government partnership with automakers could keep the plant open, but made no promises as Ryan suggested.""</p> <p>After the speech, CNN's political commentators focused mostly on Ryan's misstatements, demonstrating the degree to which they were evident.</p> <p>Top Obama adviser David Axelrod jumped on the GM factory claim. ""Again, Ryan blames Obama for a GM plant that closed under Bush. But then, they did say they wouldn't 'let fact checkers get in the way.'""</p> <p>Ryan, however, appears to have made the calculation that the misleading won't hurt him with voters. He might be right. CNN's David Gergen, while acknowledging some ""misstatements"" in Ryan's address, suggested that pundits focus elsewhere. ""But let's not forget that this was a speech about big ideas,"" he told his audience.</p> <p>UPDATE:</p> <p>For more on the closure process, which was announced in mid-2008, see the local Gazette Xtra. More than 2,000 Janesville GM workers were laid off immediately; another 57 stayed on until April 2009 as production wound down.</p> <p>UPDATE: 8/30 --</p> <p>Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Paul Ryan, defended the congressman's remarks in an email to The Huffington Post. âItâs President Obama who needs to explain his words,"" Buck said. ""The facts are clear: when the GM plant went on standby the President told the people of Wisconsin he would âlead an effort to retoolâ it and restart production. But when the bailoutâs winners and losers were decided, Janesville ended up losing. The people of Wisconsin, like so many Americans, are still waiting for the Presidentâs imaginary recovery.â</p> <p>Buck is referring to an October 2008 Associated Press report which quotes then-candidate Barack Obama saying that if he's elected, he will ""lead an effort to retool plants like the GM facility."" That's different, of course, than saying he'd retool the plant itself, but it adds context to Ryan's argument.</p> <p>Conservative media outlets have clashed with mainstream fact-checkers who have debunked Ryan's claim by noting that the plant didn't fully wind down until Obama was president in April 2009, when the final 57 workers were laid off.</p> <p>Ryan's campaign, notably, is not reaching for that technicality to defend his claim. Instead it is arguing the broader point that when the plant closed is less important than the fact it has not re-opened.</p> <p>Ryan, during his speech, referenced Obama's speech in Janesville in Feb. 2008.</p> <p>âI know that General Motors received some bad news yesterday, and I know how hard your governor has fought to keep jobs in this plant. But I also know how much progress youâve madeâhow many hybrids and fuel-efficient vehicles youâre churning out,"" Obama said at the time. âAnd I believe that if our government is there to support you and give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition, that this plant will be here for another 100 years.â</p> <p>Government support for the plant, however, was a big if -- and it wasn't an if that came through for the plant under the Bush administration. Romney, meanwhile, opposed the auto bailout, which puts the campaign in the awkward spot of criticizing Obama for not intervening enough in the private sector with government bailouts.</p> <p>The Washington Post's Greg Sargent on Thursday interviewed a Ryan-supporting Wisconsin businessman who argued that the plant may have been unsalvageable even with significant government support.</p> <p>""This morning, I spoke to a leading business official in Janesville, Wisconsin, who was at the center of efforts to save the GM plant â one who supports Paul Ryan â and he offered a nuanced version of the history that strains simplistic interpretations,"" Sargent reported. ""The official, John Beckord, who heads the pro-business group Forward Janesville, makes two key points. First, that the market for the GM product in question collapsed much faster than anyone expected it would at the time of Obamaâs speech. Second, that there is no telling whether the plant would have reopened, even if the economy had recovered faster.""</p>",Center,Left

Al Franken of unwanted kissing and groping more than a decade ago, drawing universal condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans.</p> <p>Mr. Franken, Minnesota Democrat, said he remembered the facts differently than did Leeann Tweeden, who said the unwanted encounters came in 2006 while Mr. Franken was still a comic, as they were doing a tour to entertain American troops.</p> <p>âI respect women.

1b85fb53-7798-4e93-b63c-713ce350d8cc,Report: Kushner Told Flynn to Sabotage U.S. Policy With Russiaâs Help,"Michael Flynn will reportedly testify against President Trump, saying that the then-candidate ordered him to make contact with the Russians during the election. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and is facing up to 5 years in prison.","<p>Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images</p> <p>In December 2016, Jared Kushner allegedly instructed Michael Flynn to sabotage American foreign policy in order to help a foreign regime violate international law with impunity. (That regime was, of course, Bibi Netanyahuâs.)</p> <p>More specifically: The presidentâs son-in-law told Flynn to call members of the U.N. national security council, and encourage them to block a resolution condemning Israelâs illegal settlements in the West Bank, in defiance of the Obama administrationâs wishes.</p> <p>In making this request, Kushner (arguably) violated the Logan Act â an archaic 1799 statute that prohibits private U.S. citizens from undermining the foreign policy of a sitting U.S. president through contact with a foreign power. No American has ever been convicted of violating the Logan Act (even though a long list of people have almost certainly violated it).</p> <p>To honor Kushnerâs instruction, Flynn contacted Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and asked him to impede the vote against Israelâs settlements. Shortly thereafter, Trumpâs first national security adviser told the FBI that heâd never done any such thing. In saying that, Flynn (inarguably) violated the law against making false statements to federal law enforcement.</p> <p>On Friday morning, Special Counsel Robert Mueller filed documents in federal court revealing that Flynn has pleaded guilty to the crime of lying to federal agents. Those documents stated that a âa very senior member of the Presidential Transition Teamâ had told Flynn to implore Russia (among other UNSC nations) to block the resolution. Former members of the Trump transition team subsequently told Bloomberg, BuzzFeed, and NBC News that Kushner was that âvery senior member.â</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that another anonymous transition official referenced in those documents â one who allegedly discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Flynn, around the time when he spoke to Kislyak â is exâdeputy national security adviser (and current nominee for ambassador to Singapore) K.T. McFarland. Shortly after Flynn departed the Trump administration last winter, the White House recruited retired vice-admiral Robert Harward to be its new national security adviser. But Harward turned down the job, after Trump (reportedly) refused to allow him to fire McFarland. At the time, journalists had difficulty understanding why the administration was willing to sacrifice Harward for McFarlandâs sake.</p> <p>Fox now reporting KT McFarland was the one who told Flynn to discuss the Obama admin's Russia sanctions with Kislyak. Back in February, no one seemed to understand why the WH was willing to risk so much to keep her on. pic.twitter.com/uGfruIPaJv â Natasha Bertrand (@NatashaBertrand) December 1, 2017</p> <p>Anyhow, according to the former transition official who spoke with BuzzFeed, Flynn characterized defeating the UN resolution against Israel as a âtop priority for the presidentâ:</p> <p>âJared called Flynn and told him you need to get on the phone to every member of the Security Council and tell them to delay the vote,â the person said.</p> <p>If confirmed, that call would bring prosecutors one step closer to Kushner, who also serves as a senior adviser to Trump.</p> <p>Kushner, the source said, told Flynn during the phone call that âthis was a top priority for the president.â</p> <p>The source says Flynn took the call at the Trump transition teamâs offices in the General Services Administration headquarters in northwest Washington. After hanging up, Flynn told the entire room that theyâd have to start pushing to lobby against the UN vote, saying âthe president wants this done ASAP.â</p> <p>In a statement Friday, Flynn denied the âfalse accusationsâ that he committed treason or âother outrageous actsâ against the United States. But he admitted that he erred in lying to the FBI, before saying, âMy guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counselâs Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.â</p> <p>In his conversations with Kisylak last December, Flynn also spoke about U.S. sanctions against the Putin regime. In January, he denied having broached that subject with the Russian ambassador â and Vice-President Mike Pence vouched for that claim. Unfortunately for both of them, Kislyak was under routine surveillance by the U.S. government, and a recording of their phone call exposed his fib (eventually, the Washington Post did, too). Trump subsequently fired Flynn, supposedly for having lied to the vice-president.</p> <p>Given the severity of the accusations against Flynn, one would imagine that he provided Mueller with something more incendiary than what is currently public. Kushnerâs behavior could constitute a violation of the Logan Act â but that law is widely considered a dead letter. Whatâs more, the Trump teamâs interest in derailing the U.N. resolution was hardly a secret. The president-elect was openly undermining the sitting presidentâs foreign policy over Twitter. Meanwhile, the fact that Flynn lied to the FBI about his contact with Kislyak was first reported nearly a year ago.</p> <p>If this is all there is, itâs hard to see why Mueller would be so accommodating â or why President Trump would have been so preoccupied with protecting Flynn earlier this year.</p> <p>But then, the fact that Flynn ostensibly felt compelled to lie to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador â but not about conversations he had with other foreign diplomats about the resolution against Israeli settlements â is a bit eyebrow-raising. And anyway, it isnât hard to think of reasons why Mueller might not be ready to let the public (and thus, Trump) listen in on every tune Michael Flynn has been singing.</p>",Center,Left

Many people on the Left are calling for stricter gun legislation and for Congress to act quickly in response to the shooting. Conversely, many on the Right are saying that the event should not be politicized until all information has been acquired and the dust has settled.","<p>Photo: David Becker/Getty Images</p> <p>A gunman opened fire on a crowd at a country-music concert in Las Nevada, Nevada, on Sunday night, killing at least 58 people and injuring more than 500 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.</p> <p>Amid the horrific rituals that accompany large-scale massacres, which punctuate American life more often than they used to, there were some details about the alleged murderer, Stephen Paddock, that immediately stood out. One was his age: At 64 years old, Paddock was much older than the average perpetrator of mass shootings.</p> <p>The second was the weapon he reportedly chose to carry out his massacre.</p> <p>Many experts speculated that Paddock used a fully automatic rifle, a highly unusual weapon for a civilian to obtain.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday afternoon that 18 to 20 guns, some of them automatic, were found in Paddockâs hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, from which he fired into the crowd. The New York Times reports that among the weapons were also AR-15s, which are semi-automatic. Paddock reportedly smashed two windows in his room, and set up two scoped rifles with tripods to shoot out of them.</p> <p>Fully automatic rifles, which have been common in warfare since World War I, allow the shooter to shoot nonstop, with no need to keep pulling the trigger. (They are similar to, but can differ subtly from, machine guns.) In disturbing video clips of last nightâs shooting, a nonstop patter of gunfire can be heard coming from the hotel, followed by periods of silence. The pattern led analysts to believe that Paddock was using (and repeatedly reloading) an automatic rifle.</p> <p>Itâs also possible that Paddock modified one or more semiautomatic rifles to fire automatically, in a process known as âbump,â or âslide fireâ â though doing so reliably is difficult because the guns often overheat. And some experts said the firing heard in the audio was too rapid to have come from a modified rifle.</p> <p>Semiautomatic rifles force the user to pull the trigger every time they want to fire a single shot. Such guns, particularly the AR-15 rifle â which is a modified version of the M16 military assault rifle â have become the weapon of choice in many American massacres in recent years, including in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and San Bernardino, California, in 2015.</p> <p>Such rifles are easily obtained in many U.S. states, including Nevada. But automatic rifles have been banned for civilian purchase since 1986, when Congress passed the Firearms Ownersâ Protection Act, which made it easier for Americans to buy many kinds of firearms, but nevertheless prohibited the manufacture of fully automatic rifles. (The NRAâs Wayne LaPierre actually advocated for that provision, which seems unimaginable now.) Automatic rifles manufactured before 1986 must be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, a cumbersome process.</p> <p>Even before that, the 1934 National Firearms Act, which was passed in the wake of Prohibition-era gangland violence, imposed severe restrictions on purchasing and handling automatic rifles, which involved harsh taxes and fingerprinting. Sales of the guns plummeted after the passage of that law, and their use in large-scale acts of murder in the United States has been unheard of for decades.</p> <p>Still, there are hundreds of thousands of automatic rifles in civilian hands, including more than 11,000 in Nevada, according to the ATF. How Paddock got his hands on one isnât clear.</p> <p>The suspected shooterâs brother said in an interview that Paddock was ânot an avid gun guy,â and said that âthe fact that he had those kinds of weapons â¦ where the hell did he get automatic weapons? He has no military background or anything like that.â</p>",Center,Left

Many people on the Left are calling for stricter gun legislation and for Congress to act quickly in response to the shooting. Conversely, many on the Right are saying that the event should not be politicized until all information has been acquired and the dust has settled.","<p>Before I begin, let me clearly state two things. First, as I note in the title of this post, my observations are based on early reports, and early reports are often wrong. Second, do not read this post as implying any sort of conspiracy theory of any kind. Iâm merely noting the facts as we currently understand them â and how they differ from recent mass shootings.</p> <p>As virtually everyone has noted from the abundant video footage of the incident, it certainly sounds as if the shooter used either fully-automatic weapons or semi-automatic weapons modified (through, for example, a bump fire stock) to closely simulate automatic fire. Moreover, the police are reporting that he had âmore than 10 rifles.â He apparently rented his corner room for days and may have even set up cameras to detect when police were approaching. Thatâs all strange enough, but itâs even more unusual when you consider that his own family apparently didnât know that he maintained a stockpile of guns. Hereâs this, from the gunmanâs brother, suggesting that the gunman wasnât an avid gun guy at all:</p> <p>âNot an avid gun guy at allâ¦where the hell did he get automatic weapons? He has no military background,â gunmanâs brother says pic.twitter.com/EMSKLQGYFM â CBS News (@CBSNews) October 2, 2017</p> <p>Finally, it looks like the shooter did indeed use âat least one fully automatic rifle,â which of course raises the question of how he obtained such a weapon. Purchase? Modification? Could it be a weapon his father owned? Weâre only scratching the surface of a sad and horrible story.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>FINAL UPDATE: The Washington Post has published a well-reported profile of the shooter, and while it provides a more-complete picture of an evil man, it doesnât help us understand his motive. He was the multimillionaire son of a notorious bank robber. He had no known history of mental illness, thereâs no record of radical politics, and he had no criminal history. It looks like his first crime was the worst mass murder in American history, and ISIS is still trying to take credit for his attack. These facts are unique, to say the least.</p> <p>Hopefully, the next few days will bring clarity. They may even render the shooter somehow more ânormalâ and explainable. For now, however, a dark and terrible day ends in confusion. We know what happened. We just donât know why.</p>",Center,Right

Police initially sought a woman believed to be Paddock's roommate, Marilou Danley, as a ""person of interest."" Detectives later made contact with her, and ""do not believe she is involved with the shooting on The Strip.""</p> <p>Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said an ""excess of 10 rifles"" were found in the room, but did not immediately reveal a motive, saying ""I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.""</p> <p>Paddock reportedly had about 23 guns in his hotel room, according to police in an evening press conference.</p> <p>Fully automatic weapons produced after the mid-1980s are illegal in the U.S. Those made before can still be purchased, however, buying one requires heavy regulation, including a background check by ATF and law enforcement notification. In recent years, however, some criminals have illegally converted semi-automatic weapons into automatic ones.</p> <p>Chris Michel, owner of Dixie GunWorx, said Paddock visited his store in St. George, Utah, several times and purchased a shotgun in February after passing a federal gun background check.</p> <p>""There were no red flags,"" Michel told The Associated Press. ""I had no idea he would be capable of this.""</p> <p>Paddock had been in the hotel room since September 28, according to Lombardo.

One is in stable condition after surgery, and the other sustained minor injuries. Two off-duty police officers attending the concert were killed.</p> <p>President Trump said the mass shooting ""was an act of pure evil,"" and praised first responders in an address to the nation.</p> <p>""To the families of the victims, we are praying for you and we are here for you,"" Trump said, adding that he will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with first responders and families.</p> <p>The gunman, who fired down on the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a room in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound just as police made entry to the room, according to LVMPD undersheriff Kevin McMahill.</p> <p>At this time, federal officials do not see any connection to international terrorism and little is known about Paddock's motivation, federal law enforcement sources said. The Islamic State terror group took credit for the Las Vegas shooting, saying the gunman converted to Islam months ago, but provided no evidence to back up the claim.</p> <p>FBI Special agent-in-charge Aaron Rouse said at a news conference the agency has ""determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group.""</p> <p>Clark County Commission Chair Steve Sisola told the Nevada Independent that Paddock rented two hotel rooms, one facing north and one facing east, and had previously visited the hotel two other times.</p> <p>Paddock was using Danleyâs slot machine card, which is how police got ahold of her name although she was in the Philippines at the time of the incident, Sisolak said.</p> <p>The gunman's brother, Eric Paddock, told reporters outside his Central Florida home early Monday ""an asteroid just fell on us,"" and said Stephen Paddock has no history of mental illness.</p> <p>Paddock said his brother is ""just a guy"" and he ""freaked,"" and had retired to Vegas because he liked gambling.

Machine guns in the U.S. can cost upwards of $15,000 and require the buyer to undergo a personally intrusive and months-long application process with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p> <p>Country singer Jake Owen, who performed before Aldean, told Fox News the gunfire was ""non-stop.""</p> <p>""You couldn't tell where it was coming from.

Heather Gulish Melton told Fox affiliate WZTV that her husband, Sonny Melton of Paris, Tennessee, was among the 50 killed Sunday night.</p> <p>Kodiak Yazzie, 36, said the music stopped temporarily and started up again before another round of pops sent the performers ducking for cover and fleeing the stage.</p> <p>""It was the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my entire life,"" Yazzie told the Associated Press. ""You could hear that the noise was coming from west of us, from Mandalay Bay. You could see a flash- flash- flash- flash.""</p> <p>As the thousands of fans in the crowd began to flee, Yazzie took cover and said he saw flashes of light coming from the Mandalay Bay hotel tower high above.</p> <p>Another concertgoer told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the shots sounded like fireworks, and she hid in a sewer.</p> <p>âIt was a horror show,â Ivetta Saldana told the newspaper. âPeople were standing around, then they hit the floor.â</p> <p>Retired FBI special agent and former national FBI spokesman John Iannarelli, who drove past the scene of the event just moments before the shooting took place, told Fox News the massacre was ""obviously well-planned.""</p> <p>Iannarelli added the gunman used âexpensive guns and ammunition.â</p> <p>Iannarelli noted that FBI and police are going to speak with every friend and relative, and are conducting forensic review of the suspect's computers and phones.</p> <p>The shooting at the sold-out Route 91 Harvest festival was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Itâs the first time these missiles have been deployed on this type of platform since 2014, U.S. officials with knowledge of the latest intelligence in the region told Fox News on Monday. It also points to more evidence that North Korea isnât listening to the diplomatic threats from the West.</p> <p>Foxâs report, which hasnât been independently verified, relied on leaks from unnamed U.S. officials, who apparently shared highly sensitive information with the network.</p> <p>These anonymous sources, Fox News said, had âknowledge of the latest intelligence in the region.â</p> <p>All of this would ordinarily seem like a routine report, were it not for one thing: on Twitter this morning, Donald Trump retweeted Fox Newsâ report without comment, highlighting the story for his 35 million followers â and anyone else who happens to check his page.</p> <p>Itâs often challenging to understand what the American president is thinking, but what exactly are we to make of something like this? Because at face value, Trump seems to be confirming a report based on anonymous leaks of sensitive national security information.</p> <p>After all, the president receives daily intelligence briefings â even during his 17-day vacation â which would include the latest information on North Korea. Trump, in other words, would be in a position to know whether Kim Jong-unâs regime really did load two anti-ship cruise missiles onto a patrol boat on the countryâs east coast just days ago.</p> <p>By retweeting the report, Trump appears to be giving the report his stamp of approval â since if the story were wrong, the president probably wouldnât be promoting it.</p> <p>The question for the White House is simple: why is the president using his social-media accounts to confirm reports based on leaks of sensitive intelligence?</p>",Center,Left

41428d3c-58d5-409a-b2ca-f4f47195540e,What the CBO Might Have Said about Graham-Cassidy,"Senator John McCain announced today that he would vote no on the latest Obamacare repeal bill, also known as the Graham-Cassidy proposal. Many publications have noted that this likely means the bill is dead and will not move forward. McCain said in a statement that he, ""cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,"" as it had not gone through a bipartisan, rigorous debate process.","<p>Matthew Fiedler and Loren Adler of the Brookings Institution have a speculative but interesting analysis of the Graham-Cassidy bill; itâs their best guess as to what the Congressional Budget Office would say if it had time to fully score the legislation. The top-line result is that Graham-Cassidy would reduce the number of insured by 21 million during the 2020â2026 period.</p> <p>More than anything, it reminded me of Ramesh Ponnuruâs argument that thereâs no point waiting for CBO because itâs pretty easy to imagine what theyâd say, but itâs worth digging into the report a bit.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Standard disclaimer: The bill does not lay out what happens to Obamacare funding after 2026. Congress will have to act again at that point, and you should completely ignore any estimate, from any source, going beyond that year. I will observe that rule here.</p> <p>The first thing to bear in mind is that their estimates are (naturally) based on previous work by the CBO, which rightly or wrongly believes the individual mandate to be quite effective. As many conservatives have pointed out, much of the CBOâs coverage losses thus can be characterized as people voluntarily going uninsured when theyâre no longer required to. In fairness, though, thereâs a follow-on effect as well: As healthy people opt out of insurance, premiums go up, causing more to opt out.</p> <p>The second thing to bear in mind is that since the whole point of Graham-Cassidy is to give states leeway to use (most of) Obamacareâs funding to set up their own health-care solutions, Fiedler and Adler have to guess as to what the states will do. Their solution is to divide states into four tiers that take approaches of varying generosity.</p> <p>Here they make a point that I think some conservatives will appreciate: Since money is fungible and the block grants have few strings attached, states can in effect use the cash to fund projects that have nothing to do with health care. This is how:</p> <p>All states would need to do is identify existing state health care programs that qualify for block grant funding, thereby freeing up the state dollars currently devoted to those program to be used in whatever way the state wishes. If this were a stateâs goal, the legislation makes it easy to achieve. Total block grant funding under the Graham-Cassidy proposal is $200 billion in 2026. States could almost certainly use block grant funds to support programs that provide substance abuse and mental health services; non-Medicaid state and local government spending on such services is likely to be on the order of $50 billion in 2026. As another example, states could likely use block grant funding to finance health benefits for state and local employees; state costs in this area are likely to be on the order of $200 billion in 2026. Thus, these expenditures alone are more than sufficient to absorb the block grant funding that the Graham-Cassidy legislation would make available in 2026. States would likely identify many other categories of existing programs that could be funded with block grant dollars, such as programs that compensate medical providers for uncompensated care or spending on health care for prison inmates. In other instances, states might be able to direct money into their general funds by funneling them through public hospitals. While it is likely that some of these uses are not intended by the legislationâs authors, many of them may be difficult to disallow while still providing states with the broad discretion over the use of the block grant funds that the authors clearly do intend.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>On one hand, this just means Graham-Cassidy will be even more âfederalist.â After all, it translates to more freedom for states to put the money to the use they think best â it allows them to decide the level of health-care spending in the state, not just the system through which the money will be spent. But on the other, conservatives are not fans of the federal government doling out cash to state governments for no particular reason. (An interesting possibility that occurred to me: Could liberal states play this shell game as well, and use the diverted money to, say, provide plans that cover abortion?)</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Fielder and Adlerâs division of states seems at least defensible, however much guesswork it entails. States that declined to expand Medicaid, even though the federal government promised to pick up the overwhelming bulk of the tab, would be inclined to divert their money; blue states would be more inclined to continue Obamacareâs policies. The authors caution that their estimates do not account for the turmoil states will experience as they set up their own marketplaces, or for the billâs cap on traditional Medicaid spending.</p> <p>Like I said: highly speculative, but worth digging into.</p>",Center,Right

4379eaf5-dbd2-47ca-9563-e48bffb44c2c,Fact-Checking Paul Ryanâs RNC Speech,Ryan RNC Speech,"<p>A number of liberal bloggers were arguing on Twitter that Paul Ryanâs speech contained numerous lies. Iâve broken down the fiscal and health-care complaints. Here is the summary of the charges leveled by Dave Weigel, and the summary of my analyses. The full details are here. Notably, I leave the Janesville GM plant issue out of this discussion, for others to tackle.</p> <p>Charge #1: Paul Ryan accused Obama of cutting Medicare by $716 billion, but Ryanâs own budget preserved those cuts.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>My judgment: Ryan is correct. Ryan makes the appropriate distinction between improving Medicareâs solvency and cutting its spending to fund spending elsewhere.</p> <p>Charge #2: Paul Ryan criticized Obama for ignoring the recommendations of the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission. But Ryan voted against those recommendations himself.</p> <p>My judgment: Ryan is correct. Ryanâs credibility on deficit reduction is on the record, and has been endorsed by prominent Democrats. By contrast, Obamaâs FY 2013 budget didnât garner a single vote in Congress.</p> <p>Charge #3: Paul Ryan blamed Obama for Standard & Poorâs downgrade of American government debt from AAA to AA+, but Paul Ryan is actually to blame because he resisted tax increases that would have closed the deficit.</p> <p>My judgment: Ryan is correct that Obama has presided over this historic downgrade, but Republicans deserve a meaningful proportion of the blame for the fiscal situation that Obama inherited and then made worse.</p> <p>Charge #4: Paul Ryan opposed the stimulus, but he lobbied for stimulus grants that went to his district.</p> <p>My judgment: Ryan is correct in his criticisms of the Obama stimulus, but it is true that Ryan voted for wasteful spending measures in the 2000s. In the minds of many, including me, Ryanâs courage in taking on entitlement reform redeems those earlier failures. But others may disagree.</p> <p>â Avik Roy is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the author of The Apothecary, the Forbes blog on health-care and entitlement reform.

Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and is facing up to 5 years in prison.","<p>Former U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn departs U.S. District Court, where he was expected to plead guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States, in Washington, U.S., December 1, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst</p> <p>Former national security adviser Michael Flynn made âmaterially false statements and omissionsâ to the Justice Department about his work last year for the Turkish government, according to court filings submitted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Friday.</p> <p>Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, pleaded guilty in federal court on Friday to lying to the FBI about his conversations last year with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador. (RELATED: Michael Flynn Charged With Making False Statements To The FBI)</p> <p>But Flynnâs work for the Turkish government last year has been a heavy focus of Muellerâs prosecutors. Flynnâs consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, signed a $600,000 contract in Aug. 2016, while Flynn was advising the Trump campaign, with a Turkish businessman close to Ankara.</p> <p>In a statement of offense, Muellerâs prosecutor Brandon Van Grack says that Flynn falsely claimed in foreign agent registration filings submitted to the Justice Department on March 7 that he âdid not know whether or the extent to which the Republic of Turkey was involved in the Turkey project.â</p> <p>Flynn also omitted that âofficials from the Republic of Turkey provided supervision and direction over the Turkey project.â</p> <p>Flynnâs assertion that âthe Turkey project was focused on improving U.S. business organizationsâ confidence regarding doing business in Turkeyâ was also false as was his claim that he wrote an op-ed smearing Turkish government foe âat his own initiative.â</p> <p>Flynn disclosed some details of his consulting contract when he registered as a foreign agent of Turkey under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).</p> <p>The disclosure was filed several weeks after Flynn resigned from the White House for purportedly lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Kislyak.</p> <p>In the filing, Flynn acknowledged that he was hired by the Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin, to investigate Fethullah Gulen. Turkeyâs authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, blames Gulen for a coup attempt carried out in July 2016.</p> <p>Flynn Intel agreed to investigate Gulen and also to direct a media outreach campaign aimed at smearing the exiled cleric, who lives in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>The media outreach component included a documentary that was filmed but never released. Flynn also authored a Nov. 8, 2016, op-ed calling on the U.S. government to extradite Gulen.</p> <p>A man named Hank Cox was paid $300 to edit the article, which appeared in The Hill on Election Day. Sphere Consulting, a lobbying firm that sub-contracted for Flynn Intel on the Turkey project, helped place the article. Alptekin reviewed the piece prior to publication but has told The Daily Caller that he was not involved in writing it.</p> <p>Flynnâs op-ed is what led to the revelation of his relationship to Alptekin, who hired Flynn through a Netherlands-based shell company he owns called Inovo BV. The Daily Caller discovered the Flynn-Alptekin link days after the op-ed was published. (RELATED: Michael Flynn Lobbied For Turkish Businessman)</p> <p>Trump tapped Flynn as national security adviser several days after the election. Internal Justice Department documents showed that officials in the agencyâs national security division first reached out to Flynnâs lawyers about his contract with Alptekin at the end of Nov. 2016. (RELATED: What Prompted Michael Flynn To Register As A Foreign Agent Of Turkey?)</p> <p>Flynn also appears to have omitted key details from his FARA filing about a meeting he had with Turkish government officials on Sept. 19, 2016. Alptekin arranged the meeting, which was held in New York City and was attended by Turkeyâs foreign minister and energy minister.</p> <p>Former CIA director James Woolsey has claimed in interviews that the idea of kidnapping Gulen and removing him to Turkey was discussed during that meeting. Flynn and Alptekin have denied that claim, but Mueller has been said to be investigating the allegation.</p> <p>Woolsey was an unpaid adviser to Flynnâs firm at the time. He also advised the Trump campaign.</p> <p>It was also recently reported that in Dec. 2016, Flynn was offered up to $15 million to help remove Gulen from the U.S. The Turkish government has pressured the U.S. Justice and State Departments to extradite Gulen over the failed coup attempt. The U.S. agencies say they have not seen evidence to support the Turkish governmentâs allegations.</p> <p>Flynn will not face charges from the special counsel for his misleading statements, though he could face charges in other federal jurisdictions.</p> <p>A plea agreement that Flynn signed on Thursday states that he âwill not be further prosecuted criminally by this Office for the conduct set forth in the attached Statement of Offense.â</p> <p>But the language in the agreement leaves open the possibility that Flynn could charged in other federal jurisdictions.</p> <p>âThis Agreement does not bind any other United States Attorneyâs Office, nor does it bind any other state, local, or federal prosecutor,â it reads.</p> <p>Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney who oversees the office in Alexandria, Virginia, where Flynn Intel was headquartered, had taken part in the Flynn probe. Boente, who abruptly announced his resignation in October, had used a federal grand jury as part of the investigation.</p> <p>The rest of the special counselâs statement of offense against Flynn deals with his conversations with Kislyak and members of the Trump presidential transition team.</p> <p>The statement asserts that Flynn misled FBI agents during a Jan. 24 interview in which he was asked whether he discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Flynn falsely denied that he asked Kislyak to refrain from retaliating against the U.S. after the Obama administration imposed sanctions on Dec. 28 against the Russian government for hacking Democratsâ emails during the presidential campaign.</p> <p>Flynn also contacted a âsenior official of the Presidential Transition Teamâ to develop a strategy for dealing with Kislyak, according to the statement of offense.</p> <p>Flynn and the unidentified official, who was at Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago resort, discussed âthe potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administrationâs foreign policy goals.â</p> <p>Flynn then called Kislyak and asked him not to escalate the situation and to respond in a reciprocal manner. Flynn then called the senior transition official with a briefing of the call with Kislyak. Kislyak called Flynn again on Dec. 31 informing him that there would be no retaliatory measures.</p> <p>Flynn then spoke with members of the Trump transition team about his interactions with Kislyak.</p> <p>Flynn also made false statements to the FBI about his efforts to stave off a United Nations resolution opposed by Israel.</p> <p>The statement of offense alleges that a âvery senior memberâ of the Trump transition team directed Flynn âto contact officials from the foreign governments, including Russiaâ asking them to either vote against the resolution or to delay it.</p> <p>Flynn told the FBI in January âthat he only asked the countriesâ positions on the vote, and that he did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution.â</p> <p>Kislyak informed Flynn that Russia would not be voting against the resolution, the statement of offense reads.</p> <p>Follow Chuck on Twitter</p>",Center,Right

6684a164-fc0f-432c-a65f-fc60b5811e2e,"The Deficit Keeps Falling, So Why Is Congress Leaving The Unemployed In The Cold? ",Obamacare and Jobs,"<p>A new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that budget deficits will remain low throughout this decade. Todayâs budget data means Congress has no excuse for neglecting the economy or abandoning the unemployed.</p> <p>Budget deficits have fallen sharply in recent years. In fiscal year 2009, the deficit was about $1.4 trillion, equivalent to 10.1 percent of the economy as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). Now, the CBO projects a deficit for 2014 of $514 billion, which is 3.0 percent of GDP. That means as a share of GDP, this yearâs deficit will be less than one-third of what it was five years ago. The CBO projects an even lower budget deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP in 2015.</p> <p>Unfortunately, CBOâs report also projects that total deficits over the next decade will be $1 trillion higher than they previously projected in May 2013, but the reason for this change should serve as a further wake-up call for Congress to focus on the economy. Since May 2013, CBOâs spending projections have actually fallen by $600 billion over ten years. But at the same time, tax revenue will be $1.6 trillion lower, primarily due to slower economic growth.</p> <p>Falling budget deficits in recent years may seem like good news, but this is actually the result of both positive and negative developments. On the positive side, health care costs are growing slower than expected, which saves money for federal health programs. In January 2011, the CBO projected that Medicare would cost the government $6.5 trillion from 2012 to 2021. In todayâs report, it estimates that Medicare will cost $5.8 trillion over the same period, meaning about $700 billion in savings. Projected Medicaid spending is also down about $500 billion over the same period. The other good news is that paying interest on the national debt is now projected to cost much less than before. Comparing the CBOâs January 2011 report with todayâs, projected interest payments from 2012 to 2021 have fallen by about $1.4 trillion.</p> <p>However, some of the deficit reduction has been the result of misguided austerity in Congress. It has repeatedly slashed sectors that are critical to getting our economy back on track, such as job training and scientific research. Had these counter-productive choices not held back the economy, 2.4 million additional jobs could have been created since 2010. If Congress does not reverse course, the outlook does not look good. With over $1 trillion in cuts projected over the next ten years, nondefense discretionary spending will fall to the lowest level ever as a share of GDP since the federal government started tracking this category of spending in 1962.</p> <p>One of the worst outcomes of Congressional austerity was allowing emergency unemployment benefits to expire for over a million Americans who have been unemployed for at least six months. Millions of unemployed workers rely on these benefits to keep their families out of poverty while they look for work. Reduced benefits also mean reduced consumer spending, which leads to fewer jobs and slower economic growth. If Congress fixes this mistake and extends emergency unemployment benefits, the CBO estimates that GDP will increase by 0.2 percent and 200,000 additional jobs will be created this year.</p> <p>Instead, Congressional Republicans are pointing to the slightly higher budget deficits that would result from extending unemployment benefits and refusing to pass an extension until Congress can agree on how to pay for it. But the latest CBO projections reveal that there is no reason for Congress to hold up unemployment benefits over deficit concerns. Thatâs because projected spending on unemployment benefits has already fallen substantially over the last few years. In January 2011, the CBO projected that the federal government would spend $604 billion on unemployment insurance over the next decade, which assumed that extended benefits would expire. Now it projects that the same programs will cost $525 billion over the same ten-year period. A full year extension of emergency unemployment benefits would cost $26 billion, which means Congress can pass it and still spend over $50 billion less over a decade than the program was expected to cost back in 2011.</p> <p>Todayâs CBO report shows that budget deficits are not an immediate concern. At some point, Congress will need to confront our long-term deficits, where budget projections looking several decades into the future remain concerning. Reducing long-term deficits will require many difficult choices, but the choice before Congress today could not be simpler: renew emergency unemployment benefits or abandon the workers and families who are struggling more than anyone else to make ends meet.</p>",Center,Left
6c3aa4f5-8751-491f-8dd0-5b57d9a9f8e8,Supreme Court blocks Obama immigration plan in 4-4 tie,Court Tie Blocks Obama Immigration Plan,"<p>President Obama lost his bid to kick-start his deportation amnesty Thursday after the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4, keeping in place a lower courtâs injunction, nixing the policy for the rest of Mr. Obamaâs tenure and igniting political and legal debates that will carry on well beyond.</p> <p>Mr. Obama said the ruling âtakes us further from the country we aspire to be,â and vowed to protect most illegal immigrants from deportation anyway, saying his discretionary powers remain intact.</p> <p>But the decision is a devastating blow to his hopes of a legacy-building amnesty, known by the acronym DAPA, that would have granted as many as 5 million illegal immigrants a stay of deportation and the keys to a more normal life in the U.S.: work permits and Social Security numbers enabling them to obtain driverâs licenses and other taxpayer benefits.</p> <p>The ruling could have been even worse. Had Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, still been on the court, Mr. Obama would likely have lost in a 5-4 decision that could have spanked him on broad constitutional grounds and imposed limits on future presidents, analysts said.</p> <p>Instead, the tie decision leaves in place rulings by a district judge in Texas and by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Mr. Obama broke the law when he claimed he had the categorical power to grant âdeferred actionâ to nearly half of the illegal immigrants in the country.</p> <p>Republicans hailed it as a blow to Mr. Obamaâs expansive claims of power, saying the court restored some of the balance that the countryâs founders envisioned in the Constitution.</p> <p>SEE ALSO: In wake of ruling, immigrant activists demand Obama stop all deportations</p> <p>âThe Supreme Courtâs ruling makes the presidentâs executive action on immigration null and void. The Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws â only Congress is. This is another major victory in our fight to restore the separation of powers,â said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who is leading a similar lawsuit against Obamacare.</p> <p>Mr. Obama was not cowed. He said the justices never reached the big issues of the case, so it doesnât affect any of his other policies, such as global warming and Obamacare.</p> <p>He said he will abide by the ruling, effectively ending his plans for the DAPA program. But he said most of those who would have qualified still wonât be deported because they are likely to have ties to the community and relatively clean criminal records.</p> <p>âThey will remain low priorities for deportation,â he said.</p> <p>Hispanic rights groups vowed to make Republicans pay at the ballot box in November. They said the clearest way for illegal immigrants to gain legal status is to elect lawmakers who support a path to citizenship.</p> <p>âThis act of cruelty delivered on immigrants by the Republican Party will serve as another watershed moment in the complete collapse of Latino and immigrant support for the GOP and its candidates,â said Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights at the Center for Community Change Action. âOur movement gets stronger when faced with anti-immigrant attacks. We expect the decision to be another factor in record Latino and pro-immigrant voter turnout in 2016.â</p> <p>Justices didnât release an opinion in the deadlock, and they donât say who voted on which side of the question â though based on oral arguments, itâs fairly certain the four justices appointed by Democratic presidents sided with the administration and the Republican-appointed justices sided with Texas.</p> <p>Texas argued that the program forced it to issue driverâs licenses to illegal immigrants and to pay for education and health care benefits that the illegal immigrants would also be entitled to under DAPA.</p> <p>They said the DAPA program broke federal procedural law because it was a major policy change never put out for public comment, that it broke immigration law by granting legal status to too many people and that it violated the presidentâs constitutional limits on power.</p> <p>U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen sided with Texas on the procedural law question, and then the 5th Circuit sided with Texas on the immigration law challenge. Neither court reached the bigger constitutional questions.</p> <p>Legally, the ruling leaves a number of unanswered questions.</p> <p>The lower courtsâ injunction applies nationwide, but some states have challenged that, saying that it should apply only in Texas and the 25 other states that sued to halt the amnesty. If they are successful in getting the injunction narrowed, it could leave a confusing patchwork, with illegal immigrants in some states eligible for amnesty and those in other states denied it.</p> <p>Itâs also unclear how much more Mr. Obama can push his nondeportation policies. But he took any further action off the table.</p> <p>âI donât anticipate that there are additional executive actions,â he said.</p> <p>He had said words to that effect before, however, and then reversed himself. Indeed, in the years before his 2014 announcement of the DAPA program, he repeatedly said he didnât have the power to grant such a broad amnesty because such a claim would make him a âking,â not a president.</p> <p>He began to change his mind after Congress deadlocked on legislation to grant the chance at full citizenship rights to most illegal immigrants.</p> <p>In November 2014, after massive defeats for Democrats in the midterm congressional elections, Mr. Obama announced he had been mistaken and that he did, in fact, possess broad powers to grant tentative legal status to illegal immigrants. His legal advisers said he could use âdeferred actionâ on anyone who had a speculative path to legal status â in this case, millions of immigrants with children in the U.S. legally.</p> <p>On Thursday, Mr. Obama said the courtâs ruling squanders a chance to âbring rationalityâ to the immigration system. He said itâs now up to voters to impose their will, and they need to use Novemberâs elections to send a message.</p> <p>âNow weâve got a choice about who weâre going to be as a country, what weâre going to teach our kids and how we want to be represented in Congress and the White House,â he said.</p> <p>Mr. Obamaâs 2012 amnesty, which applies to a much smaller group of Dreamers, or young adult illegal immigrants, remains in place. It was not part of the legal challenge.</p> <p>The ruling also does not affect other parts of Mr. Obamaâs 2014 executive actions, which included streamlining the citizenship process, giving more leeway to local police to refuse to cooperate with federal authorities and opening more slots for temporary workers.</p> <p>Homeland Security officials are also working on a policy of expanding âhardshipâ waivers, which would allow illegal immigrants to remain in the U.S. to care for family members.</p>",Center,Right
6d6e0d6f-ada1-4f61-a660-9a63b51a51e3,Nancy Pelosi: 'Of Course' Obama Should Take Executive Action On LGBT Workplace Discrimination,Obama raises minimum wage for contractors,"<p>WASHINGTON -- The White House has been mum on whether President Barack Obama is prepared to take executive action to ban workplace discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. But ahead of the State of the Union, House Democratic leaders say taking that step is a no-brainer.</p> <p>When asked Tuesday if she thinks the president should take action, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said, ""Of course.""</p> <p>""I agree 100 percent,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), ranking member on the House Budget Committee. ""The federal government can set an example as a major purchaser of services.""</p> <p>Obama has been reluctant to take such action because it would only be a partial fix: he only has the ability to ban workplace discrimination among government contractors, while Congress could go further by passing legislation that applies to all employers.</p> <p>But the president threw that rationale out the window on Tuesday when the White House announced he will take executive action to raise the minimum wage for government contractors, despite his continued push for Congress to take broader action on that front.</p> <p>It's not like lawmakers haven't done anything to address employment discrimination against LGBT people. The Senate passed a bipartisan bill -- the Employment Non-Discrimination Act -- that would ban workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. But House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has signaled he won't give it a vote, and in the meantime, gay rights supporters are urging Obama to act.</p> <p>While presidential action would not be nearly as comprehensive as ENDA, it would protect as many as 16 million workers in the absence of congressional action. As it stands, it is currently legal in 33 states for an employer to fire or harass someone for being LGBT.</p> <p>Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, wouldn't say outright that Obama should move forward with executive action on ENDA. But she certainly signaled support for it.</p> <p>""I think the president should use his expected authority ... in as broad a way as he can to ensure that we can move this country forward,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""On ENDA ... the ideal is to make sure that we can put it in law, make sure that it is deep in the DNA of our statutes. But like I said, I think the president is committed to using his pen as much as possible to ensure as many Americans as we can are empowered to create opportunities for themselves and take advantage of those opportunities.""</p> <p>Asked if that is a yes, she replied, ""My answers stands.""</p> <p>Pelosi and Van Hollen emphasized that they, too, preferred that Congress act on the issue. They lamented that Boehner won't let the bill get a vote, despite the House bill having 200 cosponsors, including six Republicans.</p> <p>""The Speaker should just bring up the bill,"" Pelosi said. ""The ENDA thing is so clear cut. The votes are there. The Senate has passed it. It could be on the president's desk.""</p> <p>Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the assistant Democratic leader, said he feels ""very strongly"" that Obama should take executive action on ENDA and noted that it was an 1863 executive action by President Abraham Lincoln, the Emancipation Proclamation, that led to the end of slavery.</p> <p>""I don't know where I would be today if the executive order had not been used to get rid of slavery,"" said Clyburn, who is African-American. ""These were not laws passed by Congress. The ""Lincoln"" movie was all about trying to get the 13th Amendment, to make sure that it lasted after Lincoln left the presidency. But the slaves were freed by then.""</p> <p>This story has been updated to include further developments on Tuesday.</p>",Center,Left

The Republican called Obama a âgood man,â and said that they âdiscussed a lot of different situations â some wonderful, and some difficulties.â</p> <p>A Trump administration official confirmed to NBC that Obama made it clear to Trump that he âwas not a fanâ of Flynn.

The New York Times reported that Obamaâs wariness stemmed from Flynnâs poor performance as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.</p> <p>Obama hired Flynn as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012. He was fired less than two years later, in Aug. 2014, reportedly due to management issues and because of rifts with other Obama administration officials.</p> <p>Conflicting with the NBC News and Times report was CNNâs report that Obama was concerned because, according to one source, Flynnâs âname kept popping upâ in relation to the investigation into Russiaâs meddling in the election.</p> <p>The news of the Obama warning comes just hours before former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates testifies before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee about her conversations with the Trump White House regarding Flynn.</p> <p>Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, joined the Trump campaign in early 2016 and became the most prominent former military officer in Trumpâs orbit.</p> <p>Yates will reportedly testify that she warned White House counsel Donald McGahn on Jan. 26 that Flynn had given misleading statements about conversations he had in December with Russiaâs ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.</p> <p>Yates was fired several days later for refusing to comply with Trumpâs executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.</p> <p>Trump ended up firing Flynn on Feb. 13.

Many people on the Left are calling for stricter gun legislation and for Congress to act quickly in response to the shooting. Conversely, many on the Right are saying that the event should not be politicized until all information has been acquired and the dust has settled.","<p>After expressing shock that his brother, âjust a guyâ who liked to go to Vegas and gamble and see some shows and âeat burritos,â had gone on a murder spree from the window of his room at Mandalay Bay hotel, Eric Paddock disclosed something else about Stephen Paddockâs background. It is disturbing:</p> <p>NEW: Shooter's brother says their father was Patrick Benjamin Paddock, a bank robber who he says was on FBI Most Wanted list. @tracyconnor â Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) October 2, 2017</p> <p>There was indeed in the 1960s and early 1970s a bank robber, an escaped federal prisoner, and eventually a fugitive by that name (and others) who made the Most Wanted list. According to the New York Daily News, Patrick Benjamin Paddock was arrested early in 1961 for robbing a bank in Phoenix in 1960 (he allegedly robbed other banks but was not charged with those offenses) while living in Tucson with his four children. He was caught trying to escape from jail inâsighâLas Vegas, and was sent away, before successfully escaping late in 1968, which put him on the Most Wantedlist.</p> <p>The FBI poster (see above) from 1969 notes that Paddock the Elder had been âdiagnosed as psychopathic, has carried firearms in commission of bank robberiesâ and âreportedly has suicidal tendencies and should be considered armed and very dangerous.â</p> <p>Fast-forward a couple of years, and Tucsonâs Daily Citizen gave some more background on Paddock, before reporting that he had not been seen or heard of since making the Most Wanted list:</p> <p>BENJAMIN âCHROMEDOMEâ PADDOCK Ex-Tucsonian Makes FBI List Of 10 Most Wanted By GILBERT T. MATTHEWS Citizen Staff Writer Known to his associates as âChromedome,â âOld Baldy,â and âBig Daddy,â Benjamin Hoskins Paddock is Tucsonâs contribution to the FBIâs list of 10 most-wanted fugitives. He made the list after escaping on Dec. 31, 1968, from the Federal Correctional Institution at La Tuna, Tex., where he was serving a 20-year sentence for robbing a Phoenix bank in 1960. Paddock â alias Perry Archer, Benjamin J. Butler, Leo Genstein, Pat Paddock and Patrick Benjamin Paddock â hasnât been seen or heard from since. At the time of the robbery, Paddock lived in Tucson with his wife and four children. Neighbors said they couldnât believe that the colorful businessman, then 34 years old, was involved in crime. Paddock sold garbage disposal units here under the business name of Arizona Disposer âChromedomeâ Co. He called himself âBig Daddyâ in connection with a night club operation on North 1st Avenue. Before selling the disposal units, he operated an East Broadway service station and also sold used cars. Although he was imprisoned for the S4,620 holdup of a branch of the Valley National Bank in Phoenix, Paddock also had been accused of two other bank robberies. Those charges were dropped after his conviction. Federal officers reported that when he was arrested in Las Vegas, Paddock attempted to run down an FBI agent with his car. âSince he has utilized firearms in previous crimes, has employed violence in attempting to evade arrest and has been diagnosed as being psychopathic, Paddock should be considered extremely dangerous,â said Palmer M. Baken Jr., agent in charge of the Phoenix FBI office. Baker described Paddock as being âA glib, smooth-talking man who is egotistical and arrogant.â</p> <p>Paddock apparently stayed on the lam until 1978, when he was âcaptured in 1978 in Oregon where he was running a bingo parlor.â</p> <p>The sins of the father should not, of course, be visited upon the son, but this new intel on Stephen Paddockâs family history is obviously as germane to the mystery of his savage outbreak as any random speculation or ISIS claims. It seems he was 8 when his father was convicted of armed robbery and sent to prison; 15 when the old man escaped and went on the lam; and 26 when he was re-apprehended. We donât know exactly where Stephen was at each juncture of âChromedomeâsâ criminal career, but itâs the sort of thing that could mess you up and perhaps give you an exposure to weaponry.</p>",Center,Left

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst</p> <p>Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has been charged with making false statements to the FBI, Special Counsel Robert Mueller revealed in court documents filed on Friday.</p> <p>Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, pleaded guilty to the charges at a plea hearing in Washington, D.C. on Friday morning.</p> <p>According to the charging document against Flynn, he âwillfully and knowinglyâ lied to FBI agents during a Jan. 24 interview in which he was asked about his conversations with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.</p> <p>Prosecutors say that Flynn lied when he said that during a Dec. 29, 2016 conversation with Kislyak, he did not ask the Russian diplomat âto refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia that same day.â</p> <p>The Obama administration had that day issued a new round of sanctions against Russia for hacking into Democratsâ emails during the presidential campaign.</p> <p>Flynn also falsely claimed that he did not recall that Kislyak told him that Russia âhad chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request.â</p> <p>Flynn also misrepresented a conversation he had with Kislyak on Dec. 22, 2016 about a vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution, Mueller charges. Flynn initially told FBI agents that he did not ask Kislyak to delay a vote on a resolution, and that Kislyak did not describe the Russian governmentâs response to the request.</p> <p>The resolution in question sought to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Russian diplomats did attempt to delay a vote on the resolution but eventually supported it. The U.S. controversially abstained from the vote instead of siding against it.</p> <p>The New York Times reported on Friday that Muellerâs team has emails showing that Flynn agreed to kill the vote on the UN resolution. According to The Times, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lobbied the Trump transition team for help quashing the vote.</p> <p>WATCH: CNNâS JIM ACOSTA PREDICT MUELLER WILL BE THE TIME PERSON OF THE YEAR</p> <p>Flynn was fired by President Trump on Feb. 13, purportedly because he made false statements to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Kislyak.</p> <p>Flynn acknowledged in a statement issued through his attorney on Friday that he is cooperating with Muellerâs prosecutors.</p> <p>âI recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counselâs Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country,â he said.</p> <p>Ty Cobb, the White House special counsel, downplayed Flynnâs plea agreement, noting that Flynn was ousted by the Trump administration over his claims about his conversations with Kislyak.</p> <p>âThe false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,â said Cobb, who slyly noted that Flynn served in the Obama administration.</p> <p>âNothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counselâs work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.â</p> <p>It is not clear whether Flynn will face any other charges from Mueller.</p> <p>Muellerâs team of investigators has been looking into Flynnâs consulting work, including for the Turkish government. Muellerâs investigators have interviewed numerous witnesses with knowledge of Flynnâs consulting work for a Turkish businessman with ties to Ankara. Grand jury proceedings in that investigation were recently delayed, sparking speculation that Flynn was working on a deal with Mueller.</p> <p>It has long been known that Flynn misled the FBI about his interactions with Kislyak. In February, just after he was fired as national security adviser, CNN reported that Flynn changed his story about his conversations with Kislyak but that the FBI did not plan to pursue charges in the case.</p> <p>CNNâs government sources said that it was not believed that Flynn intentionally misled the FBI.</p> <p>Muellerâs decision to reverse course on the Flynn case shows how aggressively he is handling the investigation.</p> <p>George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, accepted a plea deal in October for lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russians during the campaign. Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents in an interview conducted on Jan. 26, two days after FBI agents met with Flynn. He was arrested in July and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in October. As part of the deal he has been cooperating with the FBI and Mueller.</p> <p>Mueller has also issued indictments against former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates. The pair are accused of laundering money during their work for a Ukrainian political party with ties to the Russian government.</p> <p>Judge Rudolph Contreras, an Obama appointee, will oversee Flynnâs plea hearing.

North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test last September, at which point it claimed that it could mount a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile, a challenging technical feat that most analysts assumed was beyond North Korea.</p> <p>Kim Jong-un claimed in January that his country was on track to test an ICBM, another obstacle that some believed North Korea would struggle to overcome. Six months later, however, the North successfully tested the Hwasong-14, which experts assess can strike targets across the continental U.S.</p> <p>Many have suggested that the North has yet to develop a reliable re-entry vehicle, claiming that the re-entry vehicle failed during the last test of North Koreaâs ICBM, but there is little evidence of failure.</p> <p>For too long, the U.S. and others have been in collective denial about North Koreaâs capabilities.</p> <p>The bomb that North Korea tested late last year had a substantial explosive yield around 30 kilotons, roughly twice that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan during the Second World War. The U.S., according to the latest assessment, estimates that North Korea may have as many as 60 nuclear bombs in its arsenal, much higher than initially expected.</p> <p>North Korea has made marked achievements in the advancement of its missile program over the past year.</p> <p>The Pentagon assessed last month that the North will be able to field a reliable, nuclear-armed ICBM as early as next year, two years earlier than initially expected, but North Korea may be much closer than previously thought. North Korea has an ICBM, a powerful engine, an understanding of stage separation, a nuclear warhead, and a re-entry vehicle that can likely survive its trip back through the atmosphere. North Korea may still lack the necessary guidance controls for an intercontinental strike, but the country is moving in that direction.</p> <p>With a little more tweaking and testing, the North should be able to field a nuclear-armed ICBM. âDo not be surprised when North Korea tests a staged thermonuclear weapon,â renowned arms expert Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program in the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, tweeted in response to the WaPo article.</p> <p>Follow Ryan on Twitter</p> <p>Send tips to [email protected] dailycallernewsfoundation.org.</p> <p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Arpaio is the controversial former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona.","<p>Neither of Arizonaâs two U.S. senators â Republicans Jeff Flake and John McCain â endorsed President Trumpâs pardon Friday evening of former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio.</p> <p>âRegarding the Arpaio pardon, I would have preferred that the President honor the judicial process and let it take its course,â Mr. Flake, Arizonaâs junior senator, tweeted about an hour after the pardon was announced Friday night.</p> <p>âThe President has the authority to make this pardon, but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law as Mr. Arpaio has shown no remorse for his actions,â Mr. McCain, his senior counterpart, said in a statement of his own.</p> <p>The senatorsâ reactions came shortly after the White House announced the pardon Friday night, hardly 72 hours after Mr. Trump hinted he would clear the retired lawmanâs contempt of court conviction during a campaign style rally in Phoenix this week.</p> <p>âSo was Sheriff Joe convicted of doing his job?â Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening. âYou know what, Iâll make a prediction: I think heâs going to be just fine, OK?â</p> <p>Mr. Arpaio, 85, was convicted in July for ignoring a federal judgeâs order to stop racially profiling criminal suspects while leading the Maricopa County Sheriffâs Office in the metro Phoenix region. Heâs also frequently garnered the presidentâs praises, however, and rumors of a pardon have persisted in the few weeks since being found guilty by a federal judge.</p> <p>In a statement announcing the pardon, the White House attributed Mr. Arpaio with âprotecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration,â adding: âafter more than fifty years of admirable service to our Nation, he is a worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.â</p> <p>âNo one is above the law and the individuals entrusted with the privilege of being sworn law officers should always seek to be beyond reproach in their commitment to fairly enforcing the laws they swore to uphold,â Mr. McCain countered Friday.</p> <p>Mr. Flake and Mr. McCain have each been outspoken critics of the Trump administration since the president took office in January, and Mr. Trump took aim at both of them during Tuesdayâs rally, albeit not directly.</p> <p>âOne vote away! I will not mention any names. Very presidential, isnât it,â Mr. Trump said in reference to Mr. McCainâs dissenting vote against a Republican healthcare measure last month.</p> <p>âAnd nobody wants me to talk about your other senator whoâs weak on borders, weak on crime - so I wonât talk about him,â Mr. Trump said of Mr. Flake. âNobody knows who the hell he is.â</p> <p>âSee, I havenât mentioned any names, so now everybodyâs happy,â the president said.</p> <p>Copyright Â© 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.â</p> <p>The statement comes in a series of escalating threats and provocative moves by North Koreaâs regime. The Washington Post is reporting that U.S. intelligence officials assess that North Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles. Japanâs defense minister said âsecurity threats have entered a new stage.â Yesterday, North Korea said it would use its nuclear weapons only against the United States, and said it would âunder no circumstancesâ negotiate on its nuclear and missile weapons programs. Also yesterday, Fox News reported that U.S. spy agencies detected the North Korean military âloading two anti-ship cruise missiles on a patrol boat on the countryâs east coast just days ago,â suggesting another missile test may be on the way. Late last month, North Korea test-fired a missile that could hit much of the continental United States.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>On Twitter, the developments have generated a slew of Dennis Rodman jokes, coupled with gloomy predictions that President Trump will launch a nuclear conflict on the Korean peninsula along with his next series of angry tweets.</p> <p>The problem is that even if Donald Trump was the most level-headed, even-tempered guy on the planet . . . North Korea is still making miniaturized nuclear warheads, is testing ballistic missiles that can hit the United States, is threatening to use them against the U.S., and another test is coming soon. In other words, for all of his flaws â and he has many â Trump isnât really the problem here.</p> <p>Unless China suddenly applies a great deal more pressure to Pyongyang, either this president or the next will face a devastating choice among bad options: accept a nuclear-armed North Korea that can strike American cities, fight a conventional war before those ballistic missiles are operational, or fight a nuclear war somewhere down the road.</p>",Center,Right
80f8674b-212f-402a-b373-41be0cd7bb64,Big debate? Nahâ¦ Itâs still a Trump world and the other candidates are just living in it,Rubio Unleashes On Trump,"<p>Thursday night in Houston we met the Marco Rubio who was meant to be the most electable candidate in the Republican field.</p> <p>He was sharp, articulate, cutting, passionate and bold. And heâs been all those things before. Indeed, he was either the winner or had the second best showing as compared to Trump in the first few debates for exactly these reasons.</p> <p>But what was different on Thursday night was that Rubio showed real backbone. He knew that fresh off second place finishes he needed to make the case that not only is Donald Trump is unhinged, unprincipled and has no concrete plans, but also that he is much better equipped to be president than Ted Cruz, his chief rival.</p> <p>Cruz was certainly marginalized Thursday night. As arguably the best debater on the stage, he made very few comments that anyone will remember by the weekend. His strongest points came early on when he called Trump out for not really caring about illegal immigration since he hires illegal immigrants to build his properties and that we canât trust Trump to nominate traditional constitutionalists to the Supreme Court because heâs supported key Democratic figures like the Clintons, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi in the past. He was also strong in his defense of Israel, drawing a start contrast with Trump who has said that he would try to be neutral in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.</p> <p>But Cruz was an afterthought Thursday evening compared to Rubio. The Florida senator relentlessly hit Trump on his inconsistencies and hypocrisy. âIf Trump builds the wall [on the Mexican border] like he built Trump Tower, he'll be using illegal immigrants,â might very well be the best line of the debate and one of Rubioâs strongest points. He continually encouraged viewers to Google âDonald Trump polish workers.â Viewers who took him up on it were led to articles on Trumpâs practice of hiring illegal immigrants. Rubio also pushed Trump to define his health care plan and accused him of repeating himself â âAmerica will win againâ specifically â over and over again.</p> <p>And Rubio didnât do well by just attacking Trump. His defense of limited government, free enterprise and a strong national defense as the guiding principles of the conservative movement that he wants to be the standard bearer of was spirited and downright presidential.</p> <p>Furthermore, Rubio remains the most convincing commander-in-chief the GOP is offering. He knows his stuff and has clear plans to address all the major issues weâre facing including, but not limited to, fighting Islamic terrorism, handling North Korea and China as well as how we should be striking a balance between privacy and national security.</p> <p>That said, itâs my belief that while Rubio took advantage of his last chance to attack Trump before Super Tuesday â and that he did it very well â it wonât be enough to change the alignment of the candidates. Trump had a decent night. It wasnât his best performance, but whatâs growing increasingly clear is that it doesnât really matter.</p> <p>More so than with any other candidate, Trumpâs voters make up their minds early. They are committed to him and after big wins in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, Trump has shown that his base will turn out to vote for him even though theyâre largely from groups that donât typically vote in primaries (lower income, high school educated). And with leads in every Super Tuesday state except for Texas where Cruz is slightly ahead, thereâs no reason to think that Thursday nightâs debate changes the trajectory.</p> <p>As for Carson and Kasich, the debate in Houston showed that they really are running peripheral candidacies and there isnât much reason to go on.</p> <p>Kasich would still have a good case to be a vice presidential choice without eating up votes that could go to Rubio. And itâs not altogether clear whatâs motivating Carson to carry on.</p> <p>All this is to say that itâs a Trump world and the rest of the candidates are just living in it. We better get used to it.</p>",Center,Right

He is in Washington for a day of meetings and work, interrupting his August vacation at his New Jersey golf club.</p> <p>But he delivered the prepared statement on the heels of criticism, including from members of his own party, for not speaking out specifically or forcefully enough at first against the white supremacist groups involved in Saturday's clashes.</p> <p>The president on Saturday had condemned violence and hatred on âmany sides,â but faced swift criticism as video emerged from the scene in Charlottesville showing a car ramming into a crowd of counter-protesters. One person died in that attack; two state police also died in a chopper crash.</p> <p>Republican lawmakers joined Democrats in saying Trump should call out white supremacists directly.</p> <p>The president was again challenged, by a reporter, during a separate White House event later in the day Monday on why he did not condemn these hate groups from the start.</p> <p>âTheyâve been condemned. They have been condemned,â Trump said. When CNNâs Jim Acosta asked if the press could ask more questions, he responded, âI like real news, not fake news. Youâre fake news.â</p> <p>His remarks Monday, however, could ease some of the outcry, at least from his own party.

This statement came after bipartisan criticism of the president's initial response to the violence in Charlottesville.","<p>EXCLUSIVE: President Trump may soon issue a pardon for Joe Arpaio, the colorful former Arizona sheriff who was found guilty two weeks ago of criminal contempt for defying a state judgeâs order to stop traffic patrols targeting suspected undocumented immigrants. In his final years as Maricopa County sheriff, Arpaio had emerged as a leading opponent of illegal immigration.</p> <p>âI am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio,â the president said Sunday, during a conversation with Fox News at his club in Bedminster, N.J. âHe has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. Heâs a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him.â</p> <p>Trump said the pardon could happen in the next few days, should he decide to do so.</p> <p>Arpaio, 85, was convicted by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton of misdemeanor contempt of court for willfully disregarding an Arizona judgeâs order in 2011 to stop the anti-immigrant traffic patrols. Arpaio had maintained the law enforcement patrols for 17 months thereafter.</p> <p>The man who built a controversial national reputation as âAmericaâs toughest sheriffâ admitted he prolonged his patrols, but insisted he did not intend to break the law because one of his former attorneys did not explain to him the full measure of restrictions contained in the court order.</p> <p>He is expected to be sentenced on Oct. 5 and could face up to six months in jail. However, since he is 85 years old and has no prior convictions, some attorneys doubt he will receive any jail time.</p> <p>'Is there anyone in local law enforcement who has done more to crack down on illegal immigration than Sheriff Joe?' - President Trump</p> <p>Citing his long service as âan outstanding sheriff,â the president said Arpaio is admired by many Arizona citizens who respected his tough-on-crime approach.</p> <p>Arpaioâs widely publicized tactics included forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and housing them in desert tent camps where temperatures often climbed well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit. He also controversially brought back chain gains, including a voluntary chain gang for women prisoners.</p> <p>Civil liberties and prisoner advocates as well as supporters of immigrantsâ rights have criticized Arpaio for years, culminating in his prosecution. He lost his bid for reelection last year.</p> <p>âIs there anyone in local law enforcement who has done more to crack down on illegal immigration than Sheriff Joe?â asked Trump. âHe has protected people from crimes and saved lives. He doesnât deserve to be treated this way.â</p> <p>Stopping the flow of undocumented immigrants across the southern U.S. border was a central theme of the presidentâs campaign. Arpaio endorsed Trump in January 2016.</p> <p>Trump indicated he may move quickly should he decide to issue a presidential pardon. âI might do it right away, maybe early this week. I am seriously thinking about it.â</p> <p>Trump could decide to await the outcome of an appeal by Arpaioâs lawyers who contend their clientâs case should have been decided by a jury, not a judge.</p> <p>In a statement after the verdict, his attorneys stated, âThe judgeâs verdict is contrary to what every single witness testified in the case. Arpaio believes that a jury would have found in his favor, and that it will.â</p> <p>Reached Monday for reaction to the possible pardon, Arpaio expressed surprise that Trump was aware of his legal predicament.</p> <p>âI am happy he understands the case,â he told Fox News. âI would accept the pardon because I am 100 percent not guilty.â</p> <p>The former sheriff said he will continue to be a strong supporter of the president regardless of whether he receives a pardon.

But as the lower chamber prepares to vote Friday on a continuing budget resolution that defunds Obamacare, Democrats are declaring an official takeover of the House GOP by its tea party faction.</p> <p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday that she no longer likes to use the term ""Republicans.""</p> <p>""This is a name that has been hijacked by a segment of the Republican Party, the tea party element in the Congress,"" Pelosi said.</p> <p>Rank-and-file Democrats had similar comments.</p> <p>""What's clear is that in the fight within the House Republican caucus, the extreme tea party element won the day, at least for now,"" Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told The Huffington Post. Van Hollen, ranking member of the House Budget Committee, added that Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) ""must put the needs of American people before tea party extremists.""</p> <p>""It's pretty clear that the Republicans have allowed this group within their caucus -- the tea party leaders -- to demand that we include a repeal of health care reform as part of a CR or as part of the debt ceiling,"" said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who also sits on the budget committee. ""As a consequence of that, the speaker has allowed not the majority of his caucus, but this faction of the Republican caucus to really drive the agenda in the House.""</p> <p>Democrats are likely to overwhelmingly vote against the House GOP's continuing resolution, which would strip the Affordable Care Act of funding, lock in government spending at sequester levels and gut the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p> <p>If Republicans pass their continuing resolution, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will likely strip out the provision that defunds Obamacare and send the measure back to the House. House Democrats said they're concerned that their colleagues in the Senate, and the White House, appear willing to negotiate on the draconian budget cuts known as sequestration.</p> <p>The White House issued a veto threat on the House continuing resolution in its current form, but said it would accept a short-term measure that keeps the government open while maintaining funding for the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>""We are willing to accept a short-term continuing resolution keeping funding at current levels to avert a shutdown and allow us time to continue to negotiate over a sensible compromise on a broader budget agreement,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Thursday.</p> <p>Pelosi said she'd be open to a continuing resolution that maintains sequester cuts for ""a very short time."" Van Hollen said he's anxious to replace the sequester and has tried to do so seven times. Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.) appeared to draw a line in the sand.</p> <p>""The $988 [billion] level is not an acceptable level of funding and Iâm not as concerned about who gets blamed for a government shutdown,"" Moran told reporters Wednesday.</p> <p>Republican leaders have been reluctant to say why they caved to their tea party wing's demands on the continuing resolution.

Fox News has confirmed the report, which first appeared in the Washington Post.</p> <p>The jarring assessment was prepared in July by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The Post was read parts of the DIA analysis and the document was verified by other U.S. officials, the newspaper reported.</p> <p>Dan Coats, director of national intelligence, made similar comments to Congress in May.</p> <p>âKim was also photographed beside a nuclear warhead design and missile airframes to show that North Korea has warheads small enough to fit on a missile,"" Coats said at the time.</p> <p>âThe [intelligence community] assesses North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles,â an excerpt of the DIA analysis stated.</p> <p>Further, it is now believed that dictator Kim Jong Un may control up to 60 nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The DIA report echoed some of the evaluations made in a lengthy Japanese defense white paper also revealed on Tuesday.</p> <p>âIt is conceivable that North Koreaâs nuclear weapons program has already considerably advanced and it is possible that North Korea has already achieved the miniaturization of nuclear weapons into warheads and has acquired nuclear warheads,â Japanâs defense ministry said in the 500-page report.</p> <p>The miniaturization of a nuclear warhead was one of three things U.S. officials said the regime needed to do in regards to their long-range missile tests.</p> <p>Officials said North Korea also needed to be able to hit a target and demonstrate the ability to ""re-enter"" the earth's atmosphere.</p> <p>The regime has conducted 12 tests so far this year. One of the ICBM tests conducted in late July, in which a missile traveled 2,300 miles into space and 45 minutes into the air, was the longest and farthest ballistic missile test in the history of North Korea, officials told Fox News at the time.</p> <p>""North Korea CAN miniaturize nuclear weapons for use on ballistic missiles,"" leading North Korea expert Mark Fitzpatrick told Fox News. ""North Korea has been working on miniaturizing a war head for 30 years now."" Fitzpatrick continued, saying that the regime is ""very technically competent. It is natural that they should achieve this.""</p> <p>Regarding the Post's claim that the regime has up to 60 nuclear weapons, Fitzpatrick thinks that number is high and believes the number is closer to the 20-30 that others have estimated.</p> <p>Reactions to the news highlighted the stunning advancements depicted in the reports. Some of those who've tangled with North Korea in the past advocated throwing diplomacy to the wayside.</p> <p>""Weâve been playing the diplomatic game for a long time with #NorthKorea and itâs only given them time to advance their weapons program,"" former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton tweeted.</p> <p>Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies for the Center for the National Interest and executive editor of the National Interest magazine, told Fox News' ""Happening Now"" on Tuesday that North Korea was a ""full-fledged"" nuclear power.</p> <p>But the U.S. on Saturday achieved what appeared to be a remarkable diplomatic victory, securing the unanimous approval of tough new sanctions -- including votes from Russia and China.</p>",Center,Right

Leeann Tweeden, who has previously worked for NBC and Fox Sports and currently works on âMcIntyre in the Morningâ on KABC/790 AM, wrote on the radio stationâs website about her encounter with Franken.</p> <p>It took place in 2006 when the two of them were a part of a USO trip to the Middle East, she writes. Franken had written a sketch that had the two of them kissing and, before they performed, he insisted they rehearse it despite Tweedenâs refusal.</p> <p>He continued to insist, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable.</p> <p>He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said âOKâ so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.</p> <p>She also writes about falling asleep on the plane ride home to Los Angeles. The picture in the tweet above was taken while she slept and it was only later that she realized what happened.</p> <p>I couldnât believe it.He groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep.</p> <p>I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated.</p> <p>How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think itâs funny?</p> <p>Franken responded to Tweedenâs allegation in a statement. âI certainly donât remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasnât. I shouldnât have done it,â the statement said.</p> <p>Hours later, Franken released a longer, more apologetic statement.</p> <p>The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women. Thereâs not I want to say, but the first and most important thingâand if the the only thing you care to hear, thatâs fineâis: Iâm sorry.</p> <p>He went on to say the picture of him groping Tweeden is âdisgustingâ and likened it to having written jokes âthat I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive.â</p> <p>Tweeden said Thursday that she accepts Frankenâs apology, but wondered why he hadnât done it sooner.</p> <p>Leeann Tweeden says she accepts Al Franken's apology, but wonders why he didn't apologize to her 11 years ago when he had the chance. pic.twitter.com/2FP8dN8j3B â BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) November 16, 2017</p> <p>Franken also endorsed a call for an ethics investigation into his actions. âI am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken, and I will gladly cooperate,â Franken said.</p> <p>Such an investigation was first suggested by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said in a statement that âall credible allegations of sexual harassment or assaultâ should be reviewed by the Senate Ethics Committee. Several of Frankenâs Democratic colleagues in the Senate have also endorsed the investigation, including Tammy Duckworth, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p> <p>Later Thursday, Senate Democrats began distancing themselves from Franken by returning money their campaign received from his leadership PAC. Frankenâs Midwest Values PAC has given candidates $145,500 for the 2018 election cycle. All but $5,500 of that, which went to independent Senator Angus King, was donated to Democrats.</p> <p>Missouri senator Claire McCaskill will give $30,000 from the PAC to a âMissouri-based charity.â Ohio senator Sherrod Brown will give $28,000 to charities in his state, and North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp will give $10,000 to charities in her state.</p>",Center,Left

Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and is facing up to 5 years in prison.","<p>Photo: Pool/Getty Images</p> <p>Retired general Michael Flynn, who was President Trumpâs national security adviser before resigning in February, pleaded guilty on Friday to making a false statement to the FBI.</p> <p>Special counsel Robert Mueller charged Flynn with âwillfully and knowinglyâ making âfalse, fictitious, and fraudulent statementsâ to the agency about his conversations with Russiaâs American ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.</p> <p>Significantly, Flynn admitted as part of his plea that Trump transition-team officials had directed his contact with Russians. It is not known which officials were involved, or what, exactly, they told Flynn to do. The charges drawn up by Mueller describe Flynn discussing sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration during the presidential transition period and lying to the FBI about conversations he had with Kislyak involving sanctions.</p> <p>Flynn was taken into custody Friday morning. In a statement, he said, âIt has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of âtreason,ââ but that âthe actions I acknowledged in court were wrong.â</p> <p>White House lawyer Ty Cobb also released a statement, which claimed that ânothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn.â He referred to Flynn as a âformer Obama administration official.â</p> <p>Speculation had been mounting for weeks that Flynn, whose dealings with Russia and Turkey had long drawn scrutiny from Mueller, would cooperate with the special prosecutor in exchange for lenient treatment for him and his son.</p> <p>The relatively minor false-statement charge suggests that Flynn is divulging information to Mueller that could implicate figures even further up the chain of command.</p> <p>Flynn served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Obama until his firing in 2014. He emerged last year as an ardent supporter of President Trump, and was among Hillary Clintonâs most vicious critics during the presidential campaign, memorably telling a Republican National Convention crowd, âIf I did a tenth of what she did, Iâd be in jail today!â and joining in a âLock her up!â chant.</p> <p>Flynn was forced out of the Trump administration, purportedly because he misled Vice-President Pence about his conversations with Kislyak.</p> <p>In March, President Trump suggested in a tweet that Flynn should seek immunity from the Russia-investigation âwitch hunt.â</p> <p>This is a developing story â check back for updates.</p>",Center,Left
db078daf-d349-4793-b84e-d4df590abd67,Hillary Clinton Tech Staffer Takes Fifth Amendment,Apologizing Over Emails,"<p>(Scott Olson/Getty)</p> <p>News broke last night that Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Hillary Clintonâs 2008 presidential campaign, and later set up her private server in her New York home in 2009 (and then worked as a State Department IT employee), told congressional committees that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to requests that he testify about his involvement with the server.</p> <p>This, of course, is Paglianoâs right â and he is correct that the Fifth Amendment protects the innocent as much as the guilty. So this may be just a matter of simple self-protection, and in that respect, it is probably a wise move. Paglianoâs lawyer is an experienced former prosecutor who knows the drill. With the FBI conducting some sort of investigation into possible criminal conduct, it is usually the small fish that is the first target. By not testifying, the problem may simply go away for him. If Congress or the FBI really wants his testimony, one or the other can give Pagliano immunity from using his testimony against him in prosecution. If they donât, he canât be compelled to testify. And by not testifying to Congress, Pagliano canât lie to Congress or get caught in inconsistent statements, which is where his biggest potential for criminal exposure probably is. Many a felon has been convicted under 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1001, which prohibits false statements to the federal government as part of an official inquiry.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>But putting aside the wisdom of his decision, Paglianoâs invocation of the privilege certainly raises the question of whether there is criminal conduct in which his testimony might implicate him. Remember, this is the guy who helped set up her secret server while employed by her campaign. He later got a job in her State Department and may have played a role while there in maintaining the server. Thereâs not much reason, from what we know, to think he was involved in sending or receiving classified information. So the real concern is the server itself.</p> <p>Paglianoâs invocation of the privilege certainly raises the question of whether there is criminal conduct in which his testimony might implicate him.</p> <p>As we have noted from the beginning of this controversy, it is a felony for the custodian of a federal record (which Mrs. Clinton plainly was) to âwillfully and unlawfullyâ conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify, or destroy the same (18 U.S.C. Â§ 2071(b)). We donât know all the facts here, but there certainly are indications that Mrs. Clinton set up this server for the purpose of evading federal disclosure and oversight. As James Carville argued back in March in trying to defend her, âI suspect she didnât want [Congressman] Louie Gohmert riffling through her e-mails, which seems to me to be a kind of reasonable position for someone to take.â Reasonable only if she was not too concerned with complying with the law, perhaps.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#share#But why might this be relevant to Pagliano? Federal law also makes it a crime for any person to aid or abet another personâs commission of a crime. Pagliano canât be principally liable for concealing or destroying records under Section 2071(b) because he wasnât their custodian. But if he set up Mrs. Clintonâs server and assisted her in maintaining it knowing that the purpose was to avoid federal disclosure laws, he too might be implicated in criminal activity. That seems unlikely. More likely is that Pagliano is simply a techie who did what he was asked to do â set up a server. Again, we simply do not know all the facts here.</p> <p>#related#For Hillary Clinton, the bad news is more obvious. The optics of Paglianoâs decision are just terrible for her. This may not be a five-alarm fire, but there certainly is smoke coming from behind the walls. It becomes much more difficult to convince the public that there is nothing to see here when people start âtaking five.â Whatever inferences can or canât be drawn against Pagliano in a court of law, nothing will stop the public from drawing reasonable inferences against Hillary Clinton in the court of public opinion.</p> <p>â Shannen W.

dd518bb3-8c4f-493c-a9d9-1bfabf9b4cd0,The NSA Leak And Why You Should Never Piss Off Your IT Guy,Edward Snowden: Hero or Traitor,"<p>When The Guardian revealed the source of the NSA leaks Sunday, he turned out to be a twenty-nine year-old who was essentially a contracted IT guy for the agency without a background in national security policy, despite earlier claims by the Washington Post that they came from a âcareer intelligence officer.â</p> <p>While leaker Edward Snowden says that he was a spy for almost his whole adult life, his background suggest he wasnât an agent so much as systems admin or engineer for most of it. He reportedly attended a Maryland community college to get enough credits for a high school diploma and was studying computing, but never completed the course work and later received a GED. He then enlisted in the Army in 2003 and become a security guard at a covert NSA facility at the University of Maryland. From there he leveraged his computer skills to get a job doing IT security with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), leaving in 2009 to become a private contractor serving at a variety of NSA locations â Thatâs the role where he became âhardenedâ as he watched President Obama advance âthe very policiesâ he thought would be reined in.</p> <p>Some of Snowdenâs claims seem far fetched â like that he personally had âthe authorities to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the Presidentâ â but as one of the guys doing internal network security for the agency, Snowden did likely have a fairly far-reaching ability to access documents and chatter flowing through the system. IT security folks need to have a certain level of authority to dig down and look at whatâs happening in order to investigate possible security breaches and determine their sources, although there should be an auditing system in place to determine how often someone is looking at things they have no reason to be accessing.</p> <p>It seems that Snowden used his network authority to gather the documents that he is now leaking, although access to the content of those documents may not have been necessary to his day to day procedures. Considering Snowdenâs personal views on internet freedom and privacy (his laptop sports stickers from digital civil liberties advocacy organization the Electronic Frontier Foundation [EFF] and anonymous browsing tool Tor), itâs probable that some of the things he saw shooting over the networks set off alarm bells, thus eventually leading him to make the decision that allowing the general public access to the information was worth the personal repercussions of leaking them.</p> <p>Indeed, Snowden describes the experience as having âan awareness of wrongdoingâ that came from being in a position of âprivileged accessâ where he was exposed to âa lot more information on a broader scaleâ than the average NSA employee. And as an IT guy, Snowdenâs access to information combined with his understanding of the capacity of data collection possible and its long-term implications were also different than those of the average NSA employee. He wasnât just worried that data was being collected, but that it would eventually be used selectively to derive sinister conclusions from the actions of people living innocent lives.</p> <p>But as an IT guy rather than, say an intelligence officer, Snowdenâs divorce from the actual context of the policies has led to some disconnects between initial coverage of the leaks and what appears to be the actual workings of the programs they describe. For example, while it was first claimed that PRISM allowed âdirect accessâ to the servers of leading tech companies, later clarifications from the Director of National Intelligence suggest it was a more restricted computer interface with a legal functionality to request content data. But itâs easy to see the IT guy reading a slide that says âcollection directly from the serversâ of tech companies and interpret that as âdirect access to servers,â especially if he was never briefed on the exact functionality.</p> <p>However, the larger takeaway here is that as all sectors of our society have become more reliant on computer networks, system admins and IT professionals at large generally have much broader access to the information been carried across those networks than even the people directly responsible for the content flowing through the system. Itâs certainly scary that the NSA wasnât more careful about their custodial and auditing systems. But at its heart it looks like the reason the NSA documents are coming out now is the same reason you donât want to look at porn at work: Your IT team sees all.</p>",Center,Left
de0fef0c-23e8-4dc7-8773-3ea858e10cb0,BREAKING: Tie Vote In Supreme Court Deals Devastating Blow To Millions Of Immigrants,Court Tie Blocks Obama Immigration Plan,"<p>In an anti-climatic end to what, at one point, appeared like it would be one of the most important immigration cases to reach the Supreme Court in decades, the justices split 4â4 on Thursday on a challenge to Obama administration programs that could have allowed nearly 5 million undocumented immigrants to temporarily work and remain in the country. Though this decision is a tie and will not bind future court decisions, it is, in effect, a shattering loss for the immigrants who hoped to benefit from these programs.</p> <p>The plaintiffs in this case, led by the state of Texas, appear to have actively shopped around for a trial judge who is openly hostile to immigrants. That strategy has now paid off. The trial judge, Judge Andrew Hanen, issued an unusual nationwide injunction halting the new immigration programs. And a split decision in the Supreme Court is not enough to lift that injunction.</p> <p>Texas v. United States involves a new program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (âDAPAâ) and an expansion of the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (âDACAâ). Both programs relied on the executive branchâs broad discretion to set enforcement priorities in the immigration context, as well as longstanding laws and regulations establishing what happens to immigrants granted âdeferred action,â a kind of low-priority status which indicates that they will not be targeted for deportation proceedings.</p> <p>As recently as 2012, in Arizona v. United States, the Supreme Court reiterated the executive branchâs primacy on questions of immigration enforcement. âA principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials,â Justice Anthony Kennedy explained in an opinion joined by Chief Justice John Roberts. Indeed, executive branch officials âas an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.â</p> <p>Four years later, however, it appears that Roberts and Kennedy took a very different course. Although the one-sentence order handed down by the Supreme Court on Thursday does not indicate how the justices voted, their comments at oral argument in this case suggest that they split along party lines.</p> <p>The practical effect of Thursdayâs decision is that Judge Hanenâs order suspending the programs will remain in effect at least until a ninth justice is confirmed who can resolve this case once and for all â or, barring that, a new president is elected who does not share President Obamaâs views on immigration. In light of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellâs (R-KY) promise to confirm no one Obama nominates to the Supreme Court, that means that DAPA and expanded DACA are almost certainly dead for the duration of the Obama presidency.</p> <p>Whether they can be revived in the next presidency, moreover, will depend as much on who controls the Senate as it will on who controls the White House. Because if a ninth justice cannot be confirmed next year, it is unlikely that any current member of the Court will change their mind about this case.</p>",Center,Left

George W. Bush removed North Korea from the list in 2008.","<p>President Trump put North Korea back on the U.S. governmentâs list of state sponsors of terrorism Monday, as the administration increased pressure on Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs.</p> <p>The designation will be followed by new economic sanctions against the already heavily sanctioned communist country, said Mr. Trump, who has made confronting dictator Kim Jong-un a top foreign policy priority.</p> <p>âIt should have happened a long time ago. It should have happened years ago,â the president said when announcing the terrorist designation for Mr. Kimâs âmurderous regime.â</p> <p>âThe North Korean regime must be lawful,â he said. âIt must end its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile development, and cease all support for international terrorism â which it is not doing.â</p> <p>North Korea is one of four countries currently slapped with the State Departmentâs terror designation, joining Iran, Sudan and Syria.</p> <p>The Treasury is scheduled to announce the new sanctions Tuesday. The president, who just returned from a tour of East Asian capitals seeking to put new pressure on Pyongyang over its military programs, described those measures as the âhighest levelâ yet imposed on North Korea.</p> <p>North Korea was designated a sponsor of terrorism for two decades after it was implicated in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed 115 people. President George W. Bush removed North Korea from the list in 2008 as part of an aid-for-disarmament deal.</p> <p>âThat obviously failed because we can see where we are today,â Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters in a briefing at the White House hours after Mr. Trump announced the policy shift.</p> <p>Mr. Tillerson acknowledged that the designation was mostly symbolic because of the strong sanctions that the U.S. previously led the United Nations to impose on Pyongyang. But he said the new measure would close âsome of the loopholes.â</p> <p>Putting North Korea on the list has bipartisan support in Congress.</p> <p>But Jon Rainwater, executive director of the activist group Peace Action, said the designation failed to address the problem and could even make it more difficult to reach a negotiated settlement with the North short of military action.</p> <p>âPiling on sanctions, which have yet to deter or slow North Koreaâs progress on its nuclear weapons program, is not the answer. We need focused, unconditional negotiations that seek to freeze and roll back North Koreaâs nuclear weapons program,â he said. âThis designation makes getting to the negotiating table, let alone securing an agreement, all the more difficult.â</p> <p>Trump trip</p> <p>Mr. Trump spent nearly two weeks this month traveling in Asia and building support for confronting the nuclear threat from North Korea.</p> <p>The rogue regime has test fired several missiles, including lobbing missiles over Japan. North Korea has successfully launched intercontinental ballistic missiles that are now believed capable of carrying nuclear warheads to much of the U.S. mainland.</p> <p>In making the announcement, Mr. Trump cited the regimeâs assassination of Mr. Kimâs half brother, a political rival who in February was poisoned with VX nerve agent at an airport in Malaysia.</p> <p>The president also mentioned Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student held in North Korea for 17 months after being convicted of stealing a political poster. When he was returned to the U.S. in June, he had suffered severe brain damage and died a short time later. He was 22 years old.</p> <p>House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce applauded the presidentâs move.</p> <p>âOver the past year alone, Kim Jong-un and his regime brazenly assassinated his brother with a chemical weapon and brutally tortured Otto Warmbier, leading directly to his tragic death,â said the California Republican. âThese arenât isolated incidents, but are examples of a consistent pattern of terror.â</p> <p>He said the designation ârightly exposes the Kim regimeâs utter disregard for human life and is an important step in our efforts to apply maximum diplomatic and financial pressure on Kim Jong-un.â</p> <p>Separately, a top Chinese Communist Party official wrapped up a four-day trip to North Korea on Monday after meeting with top officials and discussing the tense state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula and other issues, The Associated Press reported.</p> <p>Song Tao, the most senior Chinese official to visit Pyongyang, North Koreaâs capital, in two years, was officially tasked with briefing the government on Chinaâs recent party congress, but his trip came almost immediately after President Trump visited Beijing for extensive talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, in which Mr. Trump urged Beijing to take a tougher line against its neighbor.</p>",Center,Right

Mike Pence, whose state is under fire over the passage of a religious freedom law that critics say could allow businesses to discriminate based on sexual orientation, said Tuesday that he and legislative leaders plan to clarify the policy in the coming days.</p> <p>""I abhor discrimination,"" the Republican governor told Fox News.</p> <p>Pence said he stands by the law and there was never any intent to create a ""license to discriminate."" But, acknowledging the furor over the policy, he said: ""We'll clarify that in the days ahead, and we'll fix this and move forward.""</p> <p>Pence later held a press conference in Indianapolis calling for legislation on his desk ""before the end of this week"" that would make clear the law does not allow businesses ""to deny services to anyone.""</p> <p>""We've got a perception problem here ... and we intend to correct that,"" Pence said at the news conference.</p> <p>The governor's statements put him in line with Indiana legislative leaders, who on Monday said they would look at clarifying the law to make clear it does not permit discrimination against gays, lesbians, transgenders and others. The effort is the latest attempt to quell a firestorm that has led two governors to ban publicly funded travel to the Hoosier State and threatens to overshadow this weekend's NCAA men's basketball Final Four, which will be held in Indianapolis.</p> <p>As signed by Pence last week, the measure prohibits state laws that ""substantially burden"" a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs. The law's definition of ""person"" includes religious institutions, businesses and associations -- triggering accusations that it might let businesses deny service.</p> <p>""What we had hoped for with the bill was a message of inclusion, inclusion of all religious beliefs,"" Republican House Speaker Brian Bosma said Monday. ""What instead has come out is a message of exclusion, and that was not the intent.""</p> <p>Bosma acknowledged a major concern is whether businesses will now be legally permitted to deny services to some people as a result of the law, and noted that even he was unclear about whether that was the case.</p> <p>""We donât believe that will be the effect,â he said. âWe are looking at options to clarify that that's the case.""</p> <p>Pence, speaking with Fox News, maintained that the law is not discriminatory. He stressed that it ""mirrors"" one signed by President Clinton in 1993 and policies in effect, either by statute or court decision, in roughly 30 states. The business provision, however, made Indiana's unique -- critics also pointed out Indiana does not have a law explicitly banning discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p> <p>Pence said he understands that, given the way some have ""mischaracterized"" the law, it may be ""necessary for us to clarify the law in legislation."" He said officials were working into the night Monday night to ""consider"" ways to do that.</p> <p>Nevertheless, some Democrats are calling for an outright repeal while even some Republicans voice concerns.</p> <p>Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a Republican, said the law threatens to undermine the city's economic growth and reputation as a convention and tourism destination and called for lawmakers to add protections for sexual orientation and gender identity to Indiana civil-rights laws.</p> <p>""I call upon Governor Pence and the Indiana Legislature to fix this law. Either repeal it or pass a law that protects all who live, work and visit Indiana. And do so immediately. Indianapolis will not be defined by this,"" Ballard said.</p> <p>After a two-hour private meeting of House Republicans, Bosma said Monday that repealing the law isn't ""a realistic goal at this point.""</p> <p>""I'm looking for a surgical solution, and I think the least intrusive surgery is to clarify that (the law) cannot be used to support the denial of goods, facilities or services to any member of the public,"" he said.</p> <p>Pence, who defended the law during a television appearance Sunday, canceled scheduled appearances Monday night and Tuesday, in part because of planned protests.</p> <p>In an essay for The Wall Street Journal, Pence said ""the law is not a 'license to discriminate'"" and reflects federal law. But the Affordable Care Act, he said, ""renewed concerns about government infringement on deeply held religious beliefs.""</p> <p>""Faith and religion are important values to millions of Indiana residents,"" he said. ""With the passage of this legislation, Indiana will continue to be a place that respects the beliefs of every person in our state.""</p> <p>Meanwhile, sports officials planned an ""Indy Welcomes All"" campaign ahead of this weekend's Final Four games. The NCAA, which is based in Indianapolis, has repeatedly expressed concerns over the law, with organization President Mark Emmert saying ""We are especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees. We intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce.""</p> <p>Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Monday they were imposing bans on state-funded travel to Indiana. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, who is openly gay, issued a similar ban via executive order over the weekend.</p> <p>""Seattleites know that discrimination has no place in our city,"" Murray said in a statement. ""Thatâs just equality 101.""</p> <p>Other elected officials have jumped on the backlash. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe issued a letter to Indiana corporations saying Virginia is a business-friendly state that does ""not discriminate against our friends and neighbors,"" while Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel sent letters to more than a dozen Indiana businesses, urging them to relocate to a ""welcoming place to people of all races, faiths and countries of origin.""</p>",Center,Right

Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesnât know or remember, with a language she may not even speak?â</p> <p>âLetâs be clear: the action taken today isnât required legally. Itâs a political decision, and a moral question. Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldnât threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us,â Obama claimed.</p> <p>âThey are that pitcher on our kidâs softball team, that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster, that cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance. Kicking them out wonât lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyoneâs taxes, or raise anybodyâs wages.â</p> <p>Obama had previously hinted that he would âweigh inâ if Trump took action on DACA, despite longstanding precedent against former presidents criticizing the current president.</p>",Center,Right
f56ed8fc-456b-47ff-913c-07facaaeea00,House passes spending bill to defund Obamacare,GOP Fighting Obamacare,"<p>House Republicans passed their stopgap funding bill Friday to keep government open while terminating the new health care law, setting up a final showdown next week with Senate Democrats and President Obama who have firmly rejected the GOP approach.</p> <p>The 230-189 vote, which split almost exactly along party lines, is the precursor to the big action next week, when the Democratic majority in the Senate is expected to strip out the health care provisions and send the bill back to the House â where Republicans will have to decide whether they can accept it at that point.</p> <p>All sides are racing to beat a Sept. 30 deadline, which is when current funding for the federal government runs out. The new measure would fund the government through Dec. 15, essentially at last yearâs levels, and would leave the budget sequester cuts in place.</p> <p>But Republicans on Friday also attached two amendments to the final bill â one to direct how government spending is prioritized in the event the Treasury Department bumps up against its borrowing limit in the coming weeks, and another that strips out funding for President Obamaâs signature Affordable Care Act, which would effectively stop its implementation.</p> <p>âThe American people donât want the government shut down, and they donât want Obamacare,â said House Speaker John A. Boehner, who rallied with fellow Republicans after the vote in a show of unity that seemed designed to quell speculation about a rebellion within the House Republican Conference.</p> <p>Republicans said the move was designed to put some Democratic senators on the spot. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor named several who are up for re-election next year, including Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu and Alaska Sen. Mark Begich.</p> <p>Democrats said the bill was an outrage that exposed Republicansâ true intention of trying to force a government shutdown.</p> <p>âIt is a wolf in wolfâs clothing,â said Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. âEither you donât know what youâre doing or this is one of the most intentional acts of brutality youâve cooked up.â</p> <p>Rep. Nita Lowey, the top Democrat on the House spending committee, said limiting government funding now would immediate consequences, such as preventing federal authorities from being able to help out as Colorado recovers from devastating floods.</p> <p>Democrats urged the GOP to negotiate with them to raise taxes in order to spend more.</p> <p>Republicans countered that if theyâd wanted to shut down government, they wouldnât have brought any bill to the floor.</p> <p>âWe are pragmatists. We know we have to pass bills to fund government. Thus this bill,â said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, Kentucky Republican.</p> <p>Copyright Â© 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

f58e6931-386f-4dfd-b007-3a0871201c79,Donald Trump may be only pro-life option left,Not Ready to Support Trump,"<p>While some conservatives are already questioning whether to support presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the general election, several prominent pro-life groups say heâs the only viable option for abortion opponents in 2016.</p> <p>Between Mr. Trump and likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton â the only presidential candidate ever endorsed by Planned Parenthood â Father Frank Pavone says the decision is easy.</p> <p>âHillary Clinton can hardly find an abortion she doesnât like,â the national director for Priests for Life said. âSheâs virtually for unrestricted abortion. Here, on the other hand, we have a man in Donald Trump who has said that abortion is wrong. He wants to protect the unborn, and heâs committed in fact to very specific steps.â</p> <p>Fr. Pavone said his group will work to convince pro-life activists to support Mr. Trump in the general election.</p> <p>âWithholding support [from Mr. Trump] at this point is in effect support for Hillary,â he said. âSometimes people might feel like, âI feel better in my conscience because I didnât cast a vote for him and I didnât cast a vote for Hillary either.â [But] you can influence the election by not voting.â</p> <p>Mallory Quigley, director of communications for the Susan B. Anthony List, said her group will also support Mr. Trump, citing his campaign promise to defund Planned Parenthood and support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortions after 20 weeks of fertilization.</p> <p>âI think achieving these goals would be a huge accomplishment, bigger than any pro-life advancement that weâve seen in our lifetime,â Ms. Quigley said, adding, âWeâre expecting Trump to be a man of his word and follow through, just as he would on any issue.â</p> <p>Clarke Forsythe, acting president and senior counsel for Americans United for Life, would not commit to supporting Mr. Trump in the general election, but said supporting Mrs. Clinton â whose position on abortion he compared to the North Korea regimeâs â is untenable.</p> <p>Mr. Forsythe said in a statement that AUL âwill be carefully and closely watching Donald Trump between now and election day, to see whether he lays out pro-life policies as well as to learn what his recommendations will be for the GOP party platform.â</p> <p>Ms. Quigley said it is the pro-life movementâs job to support pro-life candidates â and then hold them accountable.</p> <p>For instance, after Mr. Trump praised the âwonderful thingsâ that Planned Parenthood does besides abortion, the Susan B. Anthony List asked Mr. Trump to âtake off the rose-colored glasses he wears when talking about Planned Parenthood.â</p> <p>âWeâre very quick to correct Donald Trump when heâs misrepresented the movement with what heâs said,â Ms. Quigley said.</p> <p>During the GOP primary fight, pro-life groups largely supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former business executive Carly Fiorina, both of whom made defunding Planned Parenthood a central plank of their campaigns.</p> <p>Abortion opponents also questioned Mr. Trumpâs history of supporting pro-choice Democrats, including Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in elections.</p> <p>But following the death of former Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Fr. Pavone said Mr. Trump is now the pro-life movementâs last, best hope of retaining a majority on the bench.</p> <p>âWhen it comes to the Supreme Court, Donald Trump has mentioned Scalia as a model,â he said. âWell, thatâs music to our ears, naturally. We know what weâre going to get with Hillary. Even if people have doubts about what kind of people Donald Trump would nominate, the difference here is between doubt and certainty.â</p> <p>Fr. Pavone said Mr. Trump is not the ideal pro-life candidate, but added that a healthy dose of pragmatism is necessary in any election.</p> <p>âYou donât compromise on your goals or your principles,â he said. âAt the same time, you look at the situation and you say, âHow far can we go in these circumstances?â Well, either one or the other is going to be president, so we want the better of the two.â</p> <p>âWe know 100 percent where Hillary Clinton stands,â Ms. Quigley noted. âShe supports abortion up until the moment of birth for any reason. She has yet to name a single instance in which she would stand in and protect the life of the child, even sex-selection abortions, abortions for disability, up until the very moment of birth.</p> <p>âWeâve made the judgment that this is what we need to do.â</p> <p>Copyright Â© 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump on Twitter sought to undermine her testimony by suggesting she may have leaked classified information.</p> <p>âAsk Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel,â Trump wrote.</p> <p>Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel. â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017</p> <p>He was likely referring to a disputed Jan. 26 exchange in which Yates told White House Counsel Don McGahn about Flynnâs contacts. The Trump administration described this encounter as Yates giving McGahn a âheadsâup.â Yates is likely to testify that she expressed alarm and delivered the information as more of a warning. That meeting quickly made its way into news accounts, fed to reporters by anonymous sources.</p> <p>But just hours after Trump fired his initial volley, multiple reports emerged that Obama also personally warned Trump about Flynn during the Obama-Trump meeting in the Oval Office on Nov. 10. Each article quoted multiple anonymous sources from the Obama administration. Flynn had previously served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama, but had been fired. Flynn retained his security clearance even after the sacking, however.</p> <p>Trump fired Flynn in February after he misled Vice President Pence about a conversation he had with a Russian official during the transition period. However, Trump has remained publicly protective of Flynn, who was one of Trumpâs top advisers and surrogates during the presidential election.</p> <p>Asked Monday about the claims Obama warned Trump about Flynn, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, âObama made it known that he wasnât exactly a fan of General Flynnâs.â But Spicer also questioned that administrationâs current claims, asking if Obama was so worried, âWhy didnât he suspend General Flynnâs security clearance, which they had just re-approved months earlier?â</p> <p>Spicer added: ""Not only did they reaffirm that security clearance, they took no steps to suspend it or take any other action.""</p> <p>Trump is reportedly unhappy many White House officials have been willing to cast Flynn to the wolves, according to Axios, citing a source familiar with the presidentâs thinking. Part of Trumpâs expected pushback was to highlight that Flynnâs 2015 trip to Russia was carried out under a security clearance granted by the Obama administration. Trump enacted that strategy Monday morning, too.</p> <p>General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that. â Donald J.
