Claire McCaskill has tweeted in the past about meetings and phone calls she has had with Russiaâs ambassador, despite claiming on Thursday that she has never met with or talked to the diplomat.</p> <p>In a tweet on Thursday, McCaskill sought to show that Attorney General Jeff Sessionsâ meetings last year with the ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, were an outlier for sitting U.S. Senators.</p> <p>The Washington Post reported late Wednesday that Sessions met twice with Kislyak in 2016 while he was both a senator and an adviser to Donald Trumpâs presidential campaign.

The Russians reportedly assumed control over it, over a period of years ending in 2013.</p> <p>To close the deal, though, it had to be approved by a committee that included several U.S. agencies, including the State Department -- headed at the time by Hillary Clinton. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium production in the U.S.</p> <p>The Times reported that despite this role, Uranium One's chairman used his foundation to donate $2.3 million to the Clinton Foundation during this period.</p> <p>Further, former President Clinton himself reportedly got $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian firm promoting the company's stocks.</p> <p>Some of these ties were first discovered by Peter Schweizer, who is detailing them in the forthcoming book ""Clinton Cash.""</p> <p>The revelations are sure to stoke concerns about the family foundation's dealings, just days after Hillary Clinton formally entered the 2016 presidential race.</p> <p>Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon played down the latest reports.</p> <p>""No one has produced a shred of evidence that Hillary Clinton ever took action as Secretary of State in order to support the interests of donors to the Clinton Foundation,"" Fallon said.</p> <p>""To suggest the State Department, under then-Secretary Clinton, exerted undue influence in the U.S. government's review of the sale of Uranium One is utterly baseless. It mischaracterizes the nature of the State Department's participation in such reviews, and also ignores the range of other regulatory agencies that ultimately supported this sale. It is impossible to view this allegation as anything other than just another in the many partisan conspiracy theories advanced in the Clinton Cashbook.""</p> <p>The path to the deal began years earlier.</p> <p>Reportedly, Canadian mining financier Frank Giustra, with Clinton at his side, traveled in 2005 to Kazakhstan. There, Clinton voiced support for the country's president, who has a widely criticized human rights record.

0befc1d8-e3e9-43c2-bac8-1105377b63a9,NOM All In On Duck Dynasty: âHomosexuality IS A Sinâ¦ And Degrading To The Human Soulâ,Duck Dynasty Bigotry Controversy,"<p>The National Organization for Marriage (NOM) seems to have completed its disintegration from an organization that presented polished âpro-marriageâ talking points to one that applauds homophobia and openly attacks homosexuality like the rest of its fellow opponents of marriage equality. Phil Robertson, patriarch of A&E;âs Duck Dynasty, said in a new GQ interview published Wednesday that homosexuality is a sin comparable to bestiality, adultery, and prostitution, musing, âIt seems like, to me, a vagina â as a man â would be more desirable than a manâs anus,â and NOMâs Brian Brown couldnât agree more:</p> <p>Well guess what â homosexuality IS a sin in the bible, and virtually every other sacred text out there. Engaging in homosexual sex IS considered by God to be sinful according to the teachings of most religions. And sin is NOT logical. Sin is deceitful, harmful and degrading to the human soul.</p> <p>After harsh blowback for the comments, Robertson issued a non-apology, and by the end of Wednesday, A&E; had announced he was âunder hiatus from filming indefinitely.â Under the guise of a âpetitionâ that doesnât display signatures â so it will really only be used to collect information for future fundraising requests â NOM encouraged supporters to âstand with Phil Robertson,â using his comments to decry LGBT groups who spoke out, like the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and GLAAD:</p> <p>But Christianity, and every other major religion, be damned in the eyes of the HRC, GLAAD and their allies. They will brook no objection, tolerate no dissent and accept no disagreement when it comes to their orthodoxy. In their twisted worldview, anyone who dares to speak the truth about homosexuality must be punished and effectively banished from civil society.</p> <p>But HRC didnât send its letter to A&E; alone; it was a joint letter with the NAACP. Thatâs because Robertson also made racially insensitive remarks, suggesting that African Americans were more content under Jim Crow laws: âThey were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.â NOM makes no mentions of these remarks nor does it comment at all upon the NAACPâs joint reaction with HRC. This could be because acknowledging LGBT people and people of color standing in solidarity against oppressive speech would be contrary to their plans to âdrive a wedge between gays and blacks.â</p> <p>NOM is not alone in standing with Robertson. Conservatives across Twitter â tweeting with the hashtag #FreePhilRobertson â have joined together in rushing to his defense. A Facebook group called âStand With Phil Robertsonâ already has well over 300,000 âLikes.â Fox Newsâ Todd Starnes was quick to attack detractors as âanti-straight groups.â Sarah Palin eagerly reminded her fans that sheâs met the Duck Dynasty family, suggesting that âfree speech is an endangered species.â The Westboro Baptist Church urged Robertson not to apologize because they were proud he âfinally applied the Bible standard.â The American Family Associationâs Bryan Fischer proclaimed, âWhat Phil said was not hate speech. It was the truth. The truth is only hate speech to those who hate the truth.â</p> <p>It seems that Robertsonâs comments represent a new Chick-fil-A moment, a catalyst for conservatives to own their anti-gay beliefs and take umbrage when anybody criticizes them. However, as NOMâs losing record exemplifies, outright condemnations of âhomosexual behaviorâ and the sweeping proclamation that people who are gay are defying God and bound for Hell â let alone that African Americans were better off without equality under the law â are not palatable talking points writ large.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left
0c51ca10-7520-4fc3-b42d-325d5e22e1fd,"Poor, Misunderstood Mike Pence Forced to Amend Religious-Freedom Law",Indiana To Clarify New Law,"<p>Photo: Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images</p> <p>Indiana Governor Mike Pence announced today that he will support new legislation to amend and clarify his stateâs religious-freedom law, which may or may not have opened the door to legalized business discrimination against gays. Pence was forced to revise the stateâs law by a swift and overwhelming social backlash supported by a number of business leaders.</p> <p>One lesson to draw from this chain of events is that Pence and his allies either overreached or blundered, and were properly forced to retreat when liberal opponents raised well-founded objections. Instead, conservatives have reached the opposite conclusion: They have been victimized by bullying social liberals, delirious with culture-war victory. âLegal historians a century from now may be mystified by how a measure that was uncontroversial for so long suddenly became a mark of shame,â writes National Review editor Rich Lowry, âThey will find their answer in the Leftâs drive to crush any dissent from its cultural agenda, especially on gay marriage.â Similar wounded pleas have emanated from the likes of David Brooks, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Ross Douthat, and others.</p> <p>Conservatives are not wrong to discern a powerful and increasingly imbalanced array of cultural forces aligned against them. Nor is their desire to maintain some place of sanctuary for traditional social conservative beliefs. People who consider homosexuality unnatural, or a deviant choice, will continue to have the right to preach their beliefs in church, instruct their children as they see fit, exclude gay weddings from their church ceremonies, and so on. They are losing their ability to use the machinery of state government to express their moral disapproval of gays. The battleground centers on a relatively small middle ground of businesses, such as bakers and adoption agencies, that are involved in work related to marriage and child-rearing.</p> <p>Reading the conservatives, one might get the sense that social liberals descended upon the Hoosier state at random. âThe question fair-minded Americans should ask before casting the first stone is who is really being intolerant,â pleas The Wall Street Journal editorial page, employing an odd metaphor to describe a movement that is responding to the enactment of a new law. The status quo was altered here by new laws brought up by conservatives, not liberals. And despite repeated insistence by the lawâs defenders that it is exactly the same as a national law that has been in place for two decades, this is very much in dispute. As Paul Waldman explains, âthe Indiana law is different from other laws in its specific provisions. It not only explicitly applies the law to for-profit businesses, it also states that individual can assert their religious beliefs âas a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.â The federal law, and most of the state laws, only concern instances where the government is forcing a person to do something or not do something; the Indiana law directly covers disputes between individuals.â Glenn Kessler and Garrett Epps further explain the differences between Indianaâs law and previous versions. The Weekly Standardâs John McCormack argues it is ânot significantly different,â which, even if true, is not the same as insisting itâs no different at all.</p> <p>Whatâs more, some of the supporters of Indianaâs religious-freedom law have wandered inconveniently off script. The American Family Associationâs Micah Clark, who stood directly behind Pence at the billâs signing ceremony, claimed that to clarify that it does not legalize discrimination would âdestroyâ the bill. Erick Ericksonâs defense of the law builds up to a frank declaration that gay people should be denied the right to live normal lives. (âThe gay rights agenda may demand the veneer of normalcy, but nature itself will deny the gay community natural reproduction.â)</p> <p>It is possible that the vagueness of the lawâs terms was a simple failure of clarity. It is more likely that Pence and his allies had to carefully strike a balance between public and business opinion that wonât stand for openly discriminatory laws, and a large segment of his base that demands exactly that. Either way, the backlash against Indiana was a necessary and apparently successful expression of a newfound social consensus that gay people deserve the protections of equal citizenship.</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left

James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who will join via video-conference.</p> <p>State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier Sunday that Tillerson was ""making calls to counterparts in the region"" after the purported nuclear test.</p> <p>North Korea in recent months has escalated its pursuit of a nuclear weapon and a long-range missile that would land such a warhead on foreign soil.</p> <p>KIM JONG UNâS NORTH KOREA: BRINGING THE WORLD TO THE BRINK</p> <p>Such efforts have also sparked a war of words between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that has created global concerns about either side taking military action in response.</p> <p>âNorth Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success,â Trump also tweeted Sunday.</p> <p>The president also commented on South Korea's ""appeasement"" toward North Korea.</p> <p>""South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.</p> <p>The test was carried out at 12:29 p.m. local time at Punggye-ri site, where North Korea often conducted past nuclear tests. The detonation triggered an magnitude 6.3 artificial earthquake, U.S. Geological Survey said, though South Korea officials placed the magnitude at 5.7.</p> <p>Just hours before, North Korean newspaper published photos of Kim appearing to examine what it said was a nuclear warhead being fitted onto the nose of an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p> <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe immediately condemned the test, calling it ""absolutely unacceptable.""</p> <p>South Korea's National Security Director Chung Eui-yong said Sunday President Moon Jae-in is looking to respond to the test with the strongest measures possible. He said Moon will seek every available diplomatic measure, including new sanctions from the United Nations Security Council.</p> <p>South Korea will also talk with the U.S. in deploying the ""strongest strategic assets,"" though he did not specify what that specifically meant.</p> <p>Nebraska GOP Sen. Ben Sasse said: ""If North Korea has in fact successfully tested a nuclear warhead that can be loaded onto an intercontinental ballistic missile, Kim Jong Un is clearly threatening the American people. He must be confronted.""</p> <p>In July, North Korea conducted its first ever ICBM tests, a stunning jump in progress for the country's nuclear and missile program since Kim took power in 2011. The volatile regime launched a missile that flew over Japan before it splashed down into the sea last week.</p> <p>Trump issued a stern response to the tests early August and vowed to unleash ""fire and fiery.""</p> <p>In return, North Korea said it intended to attack Guam, a U.S. territory and the home to key U.S. military bases.

1c61bd7b-4273-42ac-a1b2-0661ec6212b1,Why Some Leftists Are Defending Donald Trumpâs Ties to Russia,"The opening was unruly, with the firing of the DNC Chairman and unruly Sanders supporters. But the evening was all about unity.","<p>Photo: Daniel Acker</p> <p>The cultivation of friendly candidates in elections in other countries, and efforts to intervene on their behalf, is a staple of Vladimir Putinâs foreign policy. Putinâs Russia has been proven or credibly alleged to have boosted friendly candidates in France, Germany, Austria, and, most successfully, in the election of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine. Something like this seems to be happening in the American presidential election now. Several weeks ago, Franklin Foer wrote in Slate about the web of suspicious financial ties connecting Trump and his leading Russia adviser to the Kremlin. The story attracted little attention â maybe it was too far-fetched, or maybe the daily stream of cable-news ticker-friendly public outrages spewed out by Trump, which required no inference, blotted out a much deeper one that lay half-buried. But recent events have propelled the story into the presidential campaign.</p> <p>First, in Cleveland, Trumpâs campaign, which had generally steered clear of platform disputes, threw around its weight to block a plank endorsing defensive military aide to Ukraine. Next, Trump shocked the foreign-policy Establishment by telling reporters that, contrary to decades of American policy, he might renege on Americaâs commitment to defend NATO allies in the event of a Russian invasion. And then, last weekend, emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been hacked by Russia appeared on WikiLeaks. The emails, which showed staffers pulling for Hillary Clinton despite the organizationâs professed neutrality, created a rift between bitter supporters of Bernie Sanders and the party Establishment at a time when it was trying to tamp down discord in the service of concord. Clintonâs campaign manager is now stating openly that Russia is trying to help Trump.</p> <p>And oddly enough, the drama is having a second-order effect that is more profound than the direct hit from the email story. It is prying open a deep, decades-old ideological wedge between liberals and the left at just the moment when the two wings were seeking to form a united front against Trump.</p> <p>What is the relationship between Trump and Russia? That Russia is pulling for Trump is at this point beyond any dispute. The Kremlinâs English-language propaganda channel RT and Russiaâs army of Twitter trolls, as well as Russiaâs internal propaganda, have all thrown themselves behind the Republican candidate. A series of reports (here, here, and here) have shown that Russia backed the operation to hack the DNC. Adrien Chen, who reported last summer on Russiaâs army of internet trolls that spreads disinformation abroad, noted in December that the trolls he was tracking had begun posing as pro-Trump conservatives.</p> <p>It is the other half of the equation that is more opaque. Putin is helping Trump, but what exactly is Trump giving him in return? As Foer notes, Trumpâs habit of refusing to pay back people who loan him money means regular American banks wonât lend him money anymore, making him dependent on unusual sources of financing. He has cultivated deep personal and financial ties with Russia â and to do major business with Russia, unlike a reasonably free economy, is to do business with its ruling claque. Trumpâs campaign manager, Paul Manafort, helped orchestrate Putinâs intervention in Ukraine. His Russia adviser Carter Page has deep ties to Russia and owns stock in Gazprom, the state-controlled firm that is a major source of the Kremlinâs financial and economic power. Michael Flynn, another Trump adviser, appears regularly on RT and refused to answer questions about whether he is paid to do so. Trump and Putin have exchanged lavish compliments.</p> <p>Trumpâs own financial ties to Russia are completely non-transparent and will remain so as long as he refuses to release his tax returns. With a normal candidate, the Russia connection would amount to a massive, disqualifying scandal. At minimum, the nominee would face overwhelming pressure to release his tax return â a standard requirement even without grounds for suspicion â to prove he is not getting paid by a hostile foreign power. To be clear, it is pretty improbable that Trump is literally working for Putin. But this hardly settles the question. First, for a risk as consequential as the willful penetration of the American government by a hostile power, âpretty improbableâ is not improbable enough. Second, the more likely explanation for the web of ties between Trump and Putin is still fairly damning. You have a candidate with a long record of admiring despots in general and the Russian despot in particular, surrounded by advisers in his pay, and who is flamboyantly ignorant of policy. Given these circumstances, it would be hard to imagine how Trump could form views on Russia without Putinâs influence.</p> <p>But the accusation that Trumpâs relationship with Russia reeks of impropriety, in the media now by Clinton, has provoked a furious counterattack on the left. Even the indisputable notion that Russia is trying to help Trump (far from the more explosive charge that Trump is trying to help Russia) has been assailed on the left as âMcCarthyismâ by figures like Katrina vandenHeuvel, Glenn Greenwald, and many others.</p> <p>The split runs along the same lines as the fissure between liberals and leftists dating from the origins of the Cold War. The Cold War began under the presidency of Harry Truman, a figure who was regarded by progressives of his era with emotions ranging from disappointment to outright disgust. That dismay propelled the third-party candidacy of Henry Wallace, who attracted a small but wildly enthusiastic following among idealists and the far left. Wallace lambasted Truman as a warmonger, a tool of Wall Street and big business, and a traitor to the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt (which, to the frustration of liberals, had stalled). Wallace depicted the Marshall Plan, the Berlin Airlift, and other Cold War policies as a plot to instigate World War III.</p> <p>Photo: MPI</p> <p>The hostility between Truman and the left of his era, I argued a couple of months ago, parallels the current dynamic between Clinton and the Bernie Sanders movement today. The Trump-Russia scandal has activated that same left-wing impulse. The American far left during Trumanâs era, just like today, was not pro-Russia so much as it was anti-anti-Russia, and follows identical themes: Criticism of Russiaâs domestic repression or aggressive foreign policy is merely a ploy to distract from and excuse Americaâs own failings, and provides dangerous support for American aggression, which could lead to war. So, just as the left of the â40s and â50s saw anti-Stalinism as an excuse for Jim Crow, a Glenn Greenwald today casts Russiaâs human-rights record in an implausibly favorable light, and reflexively dismisses any contrary view as simple hypocrisy. When Russia menaces Ukraine, The Nation informs its audience that this is perfectly justifiable because Ukraine is not really a country at all.</p> <p>Trumpâs pro-Russia tilt has reenergized these Cold War tropes. The left-wing writer Corey Robin heartily endorses the Republican nomineeâs statement that âWhen the world sees how bad the United States is and we start talking about civil liberties, I donât think we are a very good messenger.â And in response to liberals aghast at Trumpâs renunciation of upholding Americaâs commitment to NATO, Robin sneers at âthe prospect of sending the US military off to fight Putin or whomever it is weâre now supposed to be willing to fight over NATO.â To clear up Robinâs apparent confusion, âwhomever it is weâre now supposed to be willing to fight over NATOâ is in fact whoever invades the members of NATO, all of whom are pledged to defend each other in the event of an attack. And ânowâ is in fact since NATO was formed in 1949.</p> <p>Obviously, there are sound foreign-policy reasons for caution in American foreign policy toward Russia. Ukraine is not a NATO member, which explains why Russian incursions have not been met with a military response. The defining trait of the leftâs anti-anti-Russia stance is not a reluctance to go to war, but an automatic habit of analyzing Russiaâs behavior through the prism of American innocence and motivations, which are inevitably found wanting.</p> <p>For whatever reason, Trump is the candidate who has given the most forthright expression to anti-anti-Russian beliefs of any candidate since circa 1948 Henry Wallace (just as he has given the most open expression of racist beliefs of any candidate since circa 1968 George Wallace). As the acrimony between Clinton-supporting liberals and their foes on the left spills out on the streets of Philadelphia, this historical irony is playing a minor role. The far leftâs willingness to play into the opposing partyâs hands displays not only its continued disgust with the Democratic Partyâs nominee and Establishment, but a certain convergence of thought with the Republican nominee.</p> <p>Update: The Nation has an editorial denouncing defending Trumpâs relationship with Russia, under the headline âAgainst Neo-McCarthyism.â The Nationâs in-house Russophile Stephen F. Cohen echoes those views. The editorial hinges upon a loose definition of âMcCarthyism,â a term I would use to mean âfalse accusations of disloyalty,â but which The Nation uses to mean âany accusation of being in agreement with Russia, whether true or not.â</p> <p>The editorial asserts, ânobody has conclusively proven who hacked into the DNCâs network.â âConclusive proofâ is a pretty difficult standard, in the absence of a signed, notarized confession from Vladimir Putin. What we do have is the strong belief of experts both inside and outside the American government.</p> <p>The editorial likewise argues that poor Trump is being smeared because he wisely opposes arming Ukraine:</p> <p>To be sure, the GOP candidate has suggested that he may pursue a policy of dÃ©tente with Russia. He also, in our view wisely, threw out a reckless plank in the Republican platform that pledged to further arm Kiev. But Trump is only following the lead of the current administration. Should we assert seditious links between President Obamaâs policy and the Kremlin?</p> <p>The editorial fails to mention nearly all the disturbing evidence of Trumpâs unusually deep ties to the Russian regime, including the financial ties between his advisers and the regime, Trumpâs repudiation of NATO, extensive praise for Putin, and the drumbeat of pro-Trump propaganda from Russiaâs media. Instead, the editorial assumes that any questioning of a politicianâs ties to Russia is McCarthyism by definition.</p> <p>Inconveniently for The Nation, its anti-McCarthyism editorial seems to have been written before, but published after, the subject of its defense openly pleaded with Russia to violate American law on his behalf. The editorial laments, âliberal-media elites have joined with the Clinton campaign in promoting the narrative of a devious Russian cyber-attack.â Now Trump is also promoting this narrative â only, rather than calling it devious, itâs his actual policy.</p>",Left,Center,Left,Left
1ef62b29-032b-4b69-a7fc-50279895cfd4,Mooreâs Troubles Could Open a Door to a Democratic Senate,"Roy Moore, the highly conservative Republican candidate for Alabama's open Senate seat, has been accused of sexually assaulting a 14 year old when he was 32 years old.","<p>Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images; Whitney Curtis/Getty Images</p> <p>It is too early to predict what effect todayâs new allegations against Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore of predatory behavior toward underage girls might have on the special general election that will be held on December 12. Mooreâs immediate reaction was to deny everything and claim the story was âa desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post,â the media outlet that ran the story. But despite Mooreâs carefully cultivated image of religiosity and moral probity (he is sometimes called the Ayatollah of Alabama), the allegations are numerous enough, detailed enough, disturbing enough, and, well, creepy enough to cause him some serious problems unless they are somehow discredited.</p> <p>The alleged behavior, especially the story of the 32-year-old prosecutor whisking away 14-year-old Leigh Corfman for illicit sexual conduct after offering to âwatchâ her while her mother was in a court proceeding, is not the sort of thing that can be dismissed as a âyouthful indiscretionâ or as a product of contemporary standards of acceptable conduct. Given the multiple accusations of Moore pursuing minors during that period of his life, thereâs always the chance more accusers will now come forward.</p> <p>So this could well be a five-alarm political fire for the GOP in one of its strongholds. And it opens up the first realistic path for Democrats to secure control of the Senate by the end of 2018.</p> <p>Thanks to his long record of hypercontroversial statements compounded by not one but two occasions on which he lost his gavel as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for defiance of federal law, Moore was already more vulnerable than Republicans usually are in Alabama statewide races. The current RealClearPolitics polling average gives him only a six-point lead over Democrat Doug Jones. If the new allegations arenât dispelled very quickly, Moore could be in enough trouble to convince Democrats to make a major investment in Jones, and then anything could happen.</p> <p>The emerging situation brings back memories of the Missouri Senate race in 2012, when it was widely assumed Democrat Claire McCaskill was going to lose. Then hard-right Republican Todd Akin won a complicated primary and proceeded to destroy his candidacy with ignorant and misogynistic comments suggesting rape exceptions for an abortion ban were unnecessary because âlegitimateâ rapes donât cause pregnancy. For a while national and Missouri Republicans talked about substituting another candidate for the doomed Akin, but in the end they just watched him go down to defeat. Along with another favored GOP candidate who couldnât stop saying stupid things about rape, Richard Mourdock of Indiana, Akin helped dash Republican dreams of retaking the Senate that year. And these incidents involved unfortunate words from GOP candidates. What Moore stands accused of is far worse.</p> <p>This time around, if Moore craters, reducing the GOP Senate margin to 51/49, Democrats could have a real chance of winning back the Senate next year, despite only eight Republican seats being up for reelection. Jeff Flakeâs seat in Arizona and Dean Hellerâs in Arizona are already highly competitive. Itâs finding that third realistic target thatâs been tough for Democrats. But a Jones win this year would reduce the magic number to just two.</p> <p>Yes, a Jones win is still a reach, and to regain the Senate Democrats would have to win a large number of races involving vulnerable members of their own party. But with what looks like a possible Democratic wave forming for 2018, the landscape may be shifting dramatically. What Democrats most need now to place the Senate in play is some luck, and the prospect of another oh-so-holy cultural conservative blowing up his campaign might be just what the donkey ordered.</p> <p>And if it turns out Roy Moore is guilty of what the Post story reports, he may discover that the sin the Lord most swiftly and surely punishes is self-righteousness.</p> <p>As the Post story spreads, the odds of political punishment for Moore are climbing rapidly. Mitch McConnell is saying that â[i]f these allegations are true, he must step aside.â So is Cory Gardner, chairman of the Senate Republicansâ campaign committee. John McCain is already convinced Moore should hang it up. And even Mooreâs would-be Senate colleague from Alabama Richard Shelby will only say: âLetâs see how the story runs.â Thatâs not exactly a vote of confidence.</p> <p>But itâs not like the GOP has any lively options other than hoping Moore can somehow tough it out.</p> <p>Alabama elections division spox tells me it's ""too late"" to replace Moore on the ballot. Ballots already being printed; absentees already sent out. â Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) November 9, 2017</p> <p>Theoretically a GOP-backed write-in campaign is a possibility, but those rarely work, and thereâs not an obvious substitute candidate with the name ID and party-wide support to pull it off (unless Jeff Sessions decides to surrender his Cabinet position and reclaim his old seat). More likely, if Moore is shattered by this story, it will cost the GOP a Senate seat and make 2018 more perilous.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

At a rally on Aug. 22, he spent more than 10 minutes rereading his comments on Charlottesville, defending statues of Confederate leaders and attacking the media, which he accused âof trying to take away the history and our heritage.â</p> <p>On Thursday, Trump signed a resolution condemning white supremacy, but also reiterated his initial comments on the Charlottesville protests, arguing that âa lot of peopleâ have said he was right to condemn âboth sides.â</p> <p>âYou look at really whatâs happened since Charlottesville, a lot of people are saying, and people have actually written, âGee, Trump might have a point,ââ Trump said, while reflecting on his discussion with Sen.

It was almost exactly 42 years earlier, on June 13th, 1971, that the first batch of the Pentagon Papers were published in the New York Times.</p> <p>Like Ellsberg, Snowden's leaks have led to a public response from the president of the United States. Moreover, he is all but certain to face the same criminal prosecution that Ellsberg faced, and that Bradley Manning, the other candidate for ""most famous leaker"" status, is currently facing.</p> <p>Like Snowden, Ellsberg was an insider, a man who worked for the RAND Corporation and the Pentagon before deciding that he could no longer tolerate what he saw as the lies of the American government in Vietnam, and used the media to get his message out.</p> <p>""I spent years keeping my mouth shut as presidents lied to us and kept these secrets,"" Ellsberg told ""Democracy Now"" in 2010. ""I shouldnât have done that. And thatâs why I admire someone even whoâs accused, like Bradley Manning ... of actually risking their own personal freedom in order to tell the truth.

Mike Pence (R) accountable for the state's controversial ""religious freedom"" law.</p> <p>On Thursday, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allows businesses to discriminate against people by citing religious beliefs if they get sued. The LGBT community is often targeted by this type of discrimination.</p> <p>Tuesday's bold front page features an editorial blasting Pence for signing the law, and urging him to fix the damage it has already done to the Hoosier State.</p> <p>We are at a critical moment in Indiana's history. And much is at stake. Our image. Our reputation as a state that embraces people of diverse backgrounds and makes them feel welcome. And our efforts over many years to retool our economy, to attract talented workers and thriving businesses, and to improve the quality of life for millions of Hoosiers.</p> <p>Major companies, such as Apple, Walmart and Salesforce, have since announced they will boycott doing business in Indiana. Two states, Washington and Connecticut, said they will ban state-funded travel to Indiana.</p> <p>The newspaper's editorial board is calling for the passage of a statewide human rights law that would protect the LGBT community and take a clear stand against discrimination. Indianapolis' Republican mayor Greg Ballard took similar measures on Monday by signing an executive order that forces businesses to abide by the city's human rights ordinance, which prevents discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p> <p>So far, the state's Republican leaders have defended the law and remained steadfast in saying it does not discriminate. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Pence said the law is ""not a license to discriminate"" and ""simply reflects"" federal legislation. Other state GOP leaders said they were ""shocked"" that their religious freedom law was seen as anti-gay, and that they simply didn't anticipate the backlash.</p> <p>But Indy Star has a strong message for these political leaders:</p> <p>We urge Gov. Pence and lawmakers to stop clinging to arguments about whether RFRA really does what critics fear; to stop clinging to ideology or personal preferences; to focus instead on fixing this. Governor, Indiana is in a state of crisis. It is worse than you seem to understand.</p> <p>Read the full editorial at Indy Star.</p>",Left,Center,Left,Left

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, has been criticized for defending him after strongly supporting ""zero tolerance"" against sexual misconduct. Her comments and tone were seen by many as overly partisan and applying a double standard in defense of Democratic power.","<p>House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is facing a backlash for defending Rep. John Conyers and even questioning those accusing him of sexual harassment during a Sunday interview.</p> <p>Pelosi, D-Calif., touted Conyers, D-Mich., on NBCâs âMeet the Pressâ as an American icon.</p> <p>âJohn Conyers is an icon in our country,â she said. âHe has done a great deal to protect women.â</p> <p>She added: âI believe he understands whatâs at stake here. He will do the right thing.â</p> <p>Pelosi said Conyers, and the women accusing him, were entitled to âdue process,â but also asked: âI donât know who they areâdo you?â</p> <p>Host Chuck Todd asked whether Pelosi believed the women alleging Conyers treated them inappropriately.</p> <p>âThatâs for the ethics committee to review,â she replied.</p> <p>Pelosiâs interview drew harsh criticism on Twitter from those who accused her of playing party politics and focusing on âpower.â</p> <p>âPelosi is a survivor and knows she canât lose support in black caucus so she is gentle w Conyers. Itâs always about power,â Chairman of the American Conservative Union Matt Schlapp tweeted Monday.</p> <p>Political editor for TownHall.com and Fox News contributor Guy Benson pointed to Pelosiâs interview as an example of a âdouble standardâ used by Democrats in regard to sexual harassment allegations. Benson cited Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of pursuing teenage girls when he was in his 30s, and even sexual assault -- claims he denies.</p> <p>âIâm no Roy Moore defender, to put it mildly. But for those unable to comprehend why many conservative voters are willing to stand by him, look no further than Pelosiâs MTP performance today.

Rubio reached into Trumpâs closet, pulled out some grade-A skeletons, and tossed them across the stage at the University of Houston. But they wonât do the Florida senator any good if he canât convince viewers that theyâre real.</p> <p>Rubio started his onslaught by reminding America that Donald Trump once criticized Mitt Romney for going too far to the right on immigration. Romney had suggested that the government could get the undocumented to self-deport by making life in America hard for them. A tough policy to be sure, but one that doesnât hold a candle to the Donaldâs âdeportation force.â Yet, in 2012, Trump called Romneyâs self-deportation concept âmean-spiritedâ and âcrazy,â and argued that it ultimately cost him the 2012 election.</p> <p>The Florida senator proceeded to call Americaâs attention to Trumpâs hiring of guest workers at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach. On Thursday, the New York Times reported that since 2010, 300 American workers had applied for jobs at Trumpâs resort. But only 17 were hired, even as the club applied for over 500 guest-worker visas.</p> <p>Then Rubio dug deep into the archives and unearthed a decades-old lawsuit that Trump settled for $1 million. His crime? Staffing a wrecking crew with undocumented Polish workers.</p> <p>Trump tried to rebut these claims as best he could â which was not very well, because all of them are true.</p> <p>On his Romney remarks, Trump claimed that he hadnât objected to the candidateâs policy of self-deportation, only his policy of losing.</p> <p>âI criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. Thatâs what I criticized Mitt Romney for,â Trump lied.</p> <p>On Mar-a-Lago, Trump insisted that he could not get enough American workers to staff all the seasonal jobs his resort requires during the busy season. (Many American workers who applied for jobs at Mar-a-Lago would disagree.)</p> <p>As for the Polish workers, eventually all the mogul could sputter in his own defense was, âYeah, yeah. That was 30 years ago.â That cleared the way for the candidate formerly known as Marco Robot to improvise the best quip of the night.</p> <p>Rubio: You lied about Polish workers</p> <p>Trump: Yeah, yeah, yeah 38 years ago...</p> <p>Rubio: So there's a statute of limitations on lying? â NPR Politics (@nprpolitics) February 26, 2016</p> <p>Still, Trump never really lost his swagger. When Rubio said, âYouâre the only person on this stage thatâs ever been fined for hiring undocumented people to work on your projects illegally,â the Donald retorted, âIâm the only one on this stage thatâs hired people.â</p> <p>The audience raucously applauded the job creatorâs assertion of authority. In a world where empirical reality holds any sway over human perception, Rubio won the exchange handily. But who still believes we live in that world?</p> <p>Apparently, Marco Rubio does. Trump tried to blot out the Florida senatorâs assertion of inconvenient facts by shouting, âWrong. Thatâs wrong.â</p> <p>âPeople can look it up.

Hereâs Why That Matters.,Court Tie Blocks Obama Immigration Plan,"<p>On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an affirmative action program at the University of Texas at Austin in a 4â3 decision, after a lengthy legal battle over the policy. The decision hands a big victory to supporters of race-conscious affirmative action.</p> <p>The lawsuit began in 2008 when the plaintiff in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, Abigail Fisher â who is white â argued she was denied admission to the university based on her race.</p> <p>The University of Texas at Austin has a program often called a âTop 10 Percentâ program that accepts students who graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school class. If students donât make the top 10 percent, they can still be considered, but they would have to have a high score on a test that includes other characteristics of an applicant, such as leadership qualities â and the test factors in their race. Fisher argued that her race played too big of a factor in the schoolâs decision to deny her admission.</p> <p>The Supreme Court last considered Fisherâs case in 2013 but declined to issue a conclusive decision, sending the case back to the Fifth Circuit court for more consideration. Thursdayâs decision goes further, acknowledging that student body diversity is âcentralâ to the educational mission of many schools, and in âstriking this sensitive balance, public universities, like the States themselves, can serve as âlaboratories for experimentation.ââ</p> <p>Surprise! Affirmative Action Just Won A Victory No One Expected In The Supreme CourtJustice by CREDIT: AP Photo/Denis Poroy For the last several years, supporters of affirmative action have awoken everyâ¦thinkprogress.orgThe decision was pretty narrow in that Kennedy reiterated the importance of first attempting ârace-neutralâ alternatives before race-conscious affirmative action policies, and emphasized there needs to be a âperiodic reassessmentâ of these policies. This means that universities will have to do a lot of work to ensure their policy is effective and fair, by conducting long-term studies and analyzing data. As ThinkProgressâ Ian Millhiser points out, conservatives who oppose the policy could use the decision to bring costly lawsuits that would provide disincentives for universities to continue their race-conscious affirmative action policies.</p> <p>But the fact that race-conscious admissions policies werenât struck down entirely is certainly a win for proponents of this type of affirmative action.</p> <p>Proponents feared that they may face attitudes similar to former Justice Sandra Day OâConnor, who speculated that affirmative action may no longer be necessary. Itâs common for critics of affirmative action policies to argue that racial diversity can be achieved through other means. But the big question is whether those alternatives would produce results on par with the diversity achieved through the consideration of race â and the research shows thatâs not the case.</p> <p>Sigal Alon, associate professor in the department of sociology and anthropology at Tel-Aviv University and author of the upcoming book Race, Class, and Affirmative Action, told ThinkProgress last year that, when one considers how black and Hispanic people make up only a small fraction of all low-income youth, itâs clear that considering socioeconomic factors alone wonât cut it. Alonâs book shows that a race-neutral, class-based system would reduce the number of African American students in prestigious American universities by 50 percent and Hispanic students by 25 percent. Thatâs why it would have been unfortunate for students of color if the court decided race-conscious affirmative action would be taken off the table entirely.</p> <p>Three-quarters of the University of Texas at Austinâs student body is admitted through its âTop 10 Percentâ plan, which has led to increased racial diversity because it relies on heavily segregated schools. The top 10 percent of a predominantly black and Hispanic school will likely be students of color. ProPublica explains why, even if Fisherâs race hadnât been factored into her application, she still wouldnât have been admitted to the university. Although some students with lower test scores and grades than Fisher did receive provisional admission, that group was overwhelmingly white, Propublica reported.</p> <p>Those who oppose affirmative action have also argued that universities donât actually benefit from increased racial diversity, that students of color canât compete with their peers, and that a truly fair admissions system would only admit students based on their academic strengths. But plenty of research has proven why these arguments fall flat.</p> <p>For instance, both universities and K-12 schools that have diverse student populations have lower racial bias among students, and help students build their critical thinking skills and problem-solving skills. And despite arguments that students of color canât succeed at prestigious colleges â an argument the late Justice Antonin Scalia mentioned when the court heard the case last year â research shows the opposite: students of color actually do better the more selective the college is.</p>",Left,Center,Left,Left
35492fcc-28c7-499f-8822-711352bbcca0,Trump Stands With Putin Over Russiaâs Election Meddling,"President Trump said that he believes Vladimir Putin's claims that he did not meddle in the 2016 election, adding that Putin is ""very insulted"" by the claims. ""Every time he sees me, he said: 'I didn't do that.' And I believe, I really believe that when he tells me that he means it,"" Trump stated.","<p>Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev/AFP/Sputnik/Getty Images</p> <p>President Trump suggested on Saturday that Russian president Vladimir Putin is more trustworthy than Americaâs intelligence agencies on the matter of whether Russia interfered in last yearâs U.S. presidential election. Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump implied that he believed Putinâs claim of innocence on the issue, which Trump said came up while the two leaders were chatting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam. The two had no formal meeting at the summit, but talked two or three times on the sidelines. It was during at least one of those conversations that Russiaâs election meddling was broached, according to Trump.</p> <p>âHe said he didnât meddle,â Trump said. âI asked him again. You can only ask so many times.â</p> <p>Though he dodged a question as to whether or not he fully believed Putinâs denials, it seemed clear that Trump was more than sympathetic to the Russian leaderâs viewpoint. âEvery time he sees me he says I didnât do that and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,â Trump said, noting that he thinks Putin is âinsultedâ by the accusation, âwhich is not a good thing for our country.â Instead, echoing Putinâs consistent framing of the issue, Trump said that the meddling allegations were an âartificial Democratic hit jobâ and âartificial barrierâ making it more difficult for the U.S. and Russia to work together on shared security issues like dealing with North Korea or Syria.</p> <p>âHaving a good relationship with Russia is a great, great thing,â and this issue âgets in the way, and thatâs a shame, because people will dieâ on account of the resulting inaction, Trump insisted.</p> <p>Of course, Trump and Putinâs much-ado-about-nothing assessment flies in the face of what the FBI, CIA, and NSA have concluded, but Trump seemed to write off that analysis on Saturday. According to Trump, Obama administration intelligence officials who were responsible for the assessment â like former FBI director James Comey, former CIA director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper â are âpolitical hacksâ whose opinions are apparently worth less than Putinâs.</p> <p>âGive me a break,â Trump complained to reporters, âYou have Brennan, you have Clapper and you have Comey. Comey is proven now to be a liar and he is proven now to be a leaker. So you look at that and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with them.â</p> <p>Indeed, Trump seemed quite impressed by the strength of Putinâs statements, also remarking that, âHe says that very strongly, he really seems to be insulted by it and he says he didnât do it. He is very, very strong in the fact that he didnât do it.â</p> <p>âI canât stand there and argue with him,â Trump confessed, âIâd rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you. Iâd rather have him, you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not â¦ that whole thing was set up by the Democrats.â</p> <p>But Trumpâs attempt to smear Comey, Clapper, and Brennan ignores the fact that Trump administration intelligence officials agree with their Obama administration counterparts. On Saturday, the CIA said in a statement that current CIA director Mike Pompeo âstands byâ the U.S. intelligence communityâs conclusion that Russia attempted to influence last yearâs election. This was a reiteration of Pompeoâs previous comments on the subject. Furthermore, other Trump administration intelligence officials like current Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, FBI director Christopher Wray, and NSA director Mike Rogers have agreed that Russia meddled in last yearâs election.</p> <p>Putinâs meddling also came up at the first official meeting with Trump at Julyâs G20 summit in Germany. After that meeting, Trump said that the two would not be able to agree about the meddling and should move on. The Kremlin, meanwhile, said at the time that Trump had in fact accepted Putinâs denials â an account which has more credibility after Trumpâs comments on Saturday.</p> <p>This time, Putinâs press secretary denied that the topic even came up while Putin and Trump chatted at the Asia summit, and the Kremlin said that the leaders had only discussed Syria and âconfirmed their determination to defeat ISISâ in the country, per a joint statement released by Russia. As far as Putin himself, he remarked on Saturday that U.S.-Russia relations âhave not come out of the crisis state yet,â but that âwe are prepared to turn the page and go forward to look into the future to solve the problems that are of interest to people of the United States and people of the Russian Federation.â The ongoing Russia investigation in the U.S. is only âa manifestation of a continuing domestic political struggle,â according to Putin. On that point, Trump and Putin have always been in agreement.</p>",Left,Center,Left,Left

The acerbic speech accused the president of leaving his legions of voters with little more than a record of squandered opportunities and broken promises as they stare at ""fading Obama posters"" and look for work.</p> <p>âIt all started off with stirring speeches, Greek columns, the thrill of something new,â Ryan said. âNow all thatâs left is a presidency adrift, surviving on slogans that already seem tired, grasping at a moment that has already passed, like a ship trying to sail on yesterdayâs wind.â</p> <p>From start to finish, the speech was an unceasing assault on Obamaâs record. By the end, he drew thunderous cheers and applause from the convention crowd. And as he has in the past, Ryan tried to draw a sharp contrast throughout.</p> <p>Obamaâs term, he said, has been âa dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next, a government-planned life, a country where everything is free but us.â</p> <p>Ryan pledged a new direction: ""We will not duck the tough issues, we will lead.""</p> <p>He vowed to rein in the size of government, and called on the party to take the journey with them.</p> <p>âBefore the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nationâs economic problems,â Ryan said. âAnd Iâm going to level with you. We donât have that much time. But if we are serious, and smart, and we lead, we can do this.â</p> <p>Of the Democrats, he said, âTheir moment came and went.â</p> <p>Ryan catalogued a litany of grievances against the president, from the stimulus and accompanying funding for companies like Solyndra -- âwith their gold-plated connections â¦ and make-believe marketsâ -- to the health care overhaul.</p> <p>His inner numbers-guy emerged as he tried to explain the disconnect between the economic crisis when Obama took office and Obamaâs actions in those first couple years.</p> <p>âHere we were, faced with a massive job crisis â so deep that if everyone out of work stood in single file, that unemployment line would stretch the length of the entire American continent,â Ryan said. âYou would think that any president, whatever his party, would make job creation, and nothing else, his first order of economic business.â</p> <p>He went on: âInstead, we got a long, divisive, all-or-nothing attempt to put the federal government in charge of health care.â</p> <p>Ryan also renewed the ticketâs pledge to repeal âObamaCareâ and continued to claim that he and Romney invite a debate about Medicare -- which Democrats have tried to use against Ryan because of his own controversial plan.</p> <p>But Ryan repeated the argument that the federal health care overhaul is the real danger for Medicare seniors because of the cuts it makes.</p> <p>âThe greatest threat to Medicare is ObamaCare, and weâre going to stop it,â he said. âSo our opponents can consider themselves on notice. In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the left isnât going to work.â</p> <p>Ryan brought the crowd to its feet when he took the stage and again when he left it.</p> <p>""After four years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround,"" Ryan said at the top, ""and the man for the job is Gov. Mitt Romney.""</p> <p>Ryanâs speech sets the stage for Mitt Romneyâs nomination acceptance speech Thursday, which will close out the partyâs convention and be the GOPâs last word before Democrats convene in Charlotte, N.C., for their nomination gala.</p> <p>New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired up the crowd on the opening night, which was delayed by a day over Tropical Storm Isaac, but Christie left it to Ryan to get into the particulars of what a Romney-Ryan ticket would pledge to achieve for America.</p> <p>Those particulars have proved controversial.</p> <p>Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, is the author of a Medicare plan that has been a punching bag for Democrats for years now, but even more so since he was tapped as Romneyâs running mate. Democrats continued to hammer Ryan on the morning of the speech, releasing a Web video that cast him as a regressive choice from a âbygone era.â</p> <p>Ryan, though, known for his strict fitness regimen and hobbies ranging from bow-hunting to heavy metal, has brought a vitality to the ticket and has challenged efforts to caricature him as a one-dimensional soak-the-poor conservative.</p> <p>His selection as GOP running mate was hailed by many conservatives as a serious choice for serious times -- which is how Ryan sought to cast the Romney-Ryan ticket Wednesday night going into the November election.</p> <p>Jazzed-up delegates pouring into the halls after the speech told FoxNews.com they liked what they heard.</p> <p>âI think he hit a home run,â said Gerry Geer, a 74-year-old Navy veteran and alternate delegate from Pennsylvania. âHe brought up things that nobody has so far this week, like Solyndra. Iâm pretty sure Paul Ryan is the one.â</p> <p>Randy Pullen, an Arizona delegate and former state party chairman, called the speech âfabulous.â</p> <p>âHe said it the way it was: four years of failure -- blame, blame, blame. â¦ He also vowed to cut spending to put us back on track, back to where we were 10 years ago,â Pullen said.</p>",Right,Right,Right,Right

36b2a365-18da-47ec-80ca-0925a7b38257,"James Comey, FBI director, reopens Clinton email investigation","On Friday, the FBI announced that it has now reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server after discoveries it made from its investigation of Congressman Anthony Weiner's activities.","<p>The FBI has renewed its investigation into Hillary Clintonâs secret emails, Director James Comey told Congress in a new letter Friday, heightening the stakes for the Democratic presidential nominee with less than two weeks before Election Day.</p> <p>Mr. Comey said his agents learned of new emails âpertinentâ to their probe while working on an unrelated case. He said his agents need to review those messages to see whether they contain classified information and whether they affect his previous decision.</p> <p>In July, Mr. Comey announced that while he determined Mrs. Clinton did mishandle classified information, she was too inept to know the risks she was running, so he couldnât prove she did it intentionally â undercutting a criminal case.</p> <p>His new announcement Friday threatened to upend the presidential campaign.</p> <p>John Podesta, Mrs. Clintonâs campaign chairman, demanded Mr. Comey explain what new information heâs found, and blamed Republicans for âbrowbeatingâ the FBI into Fridayâs decision.</p> <p>âDirector Comeyâs letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant,â he said.</p> <p>SEE ALSO: The FBIâs sideways handling of Hillary</p> <p>âIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.â</p> <p>Mrs. Clintonâs running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, said Mr. Comey owes the campaign and the public a âclearer accountingâ of the new information.</p> <p>âWhen you do this 11 days before a presidential election, and you donât provide many details â but details apparently are being given by the FBI to the press â this is very, very troubling,â Mr. Kaine told VICE News. âWe hope that the director, and we really think that he should, give a clearer accounting of exactly whatâs going on right now.â</p> <p>Mr. Podesta predicted the FBI would come to the same conclusion this time as it did in July, and he pointedly noted that the letter was sent to eight Republican committee chairman in Congress. But it was also carbon-copied to the ranking Democrats.</p> <p>Mr. Comey did not explain in his letter to what information the new emails contain, how long it will take to evaluate them, nor how they were obtained.</p> <p>The New York Times reported Friday that the emails were snagged as part of an investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, and allegations he sent illicit messages through text and social media applications to a 15-year-old North Carolina girl. The paper reported that law enforcement officials seized at least one device shared by Mr. Weiner and his now estranged wife, Huma Abedin â a top personal aide to Mrs. Clinton. The couple announced they were separating in August amid Mr. Weinerâs involvement in another sexting scandal, but before the 15-year-old girlâs allegations surfaced.</p> <p>As Mrs. Clintonâs top personal aide, Ms. Abedin also had an account on the secret Clinton email server and exchanged classified information with her boss.</p> <p>Mr. Comey said he was briefed on the new emails on Thursday and felt it was important to promptly alert Congress of investigatorsâ latest efforts.</p> <p>Republican leaders who were among the eight recipients of the letter called for further disclosures by the FBI director, with Sen. Richard C. Shelby urging him to provide additional information before voters go to the polls Nov. 8.</p> <p>âWhile I am pleased that the FBI is re-opening this case in light of new information, it is imperative that the Bureau immediately evaluate the material to complete this investigation,â said Mr. Shelby, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. âThe American people are electing their next Commander-in-Chief only days from now, and they deserve to know the conclusion of your review prior to Election Day.â</p> <p>Sen. Charles E. Grassley, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee was one of the letterâs recipients, said Mr. Comey owes the country more of an explanation about what heâs found.</p> <p>âThe letter from Director Comey was unsolicited and, quite honestly, surprising. But itâs left a lot more questions than answers for both the FBI and Secretary Clinton,â the Iowa Republican said.</p> <p>GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, campaigning in Manchester, New Hampshire, said he respected the FBI for reversing itself.</p> <p>âPerhaps, finally, justice will be done,â he said.</p> <p>For her part Mrs. Clinton, campaigning in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, did not address the issue, instead sticking doggedly to her stump speech of attacks on Mr. Trump mixed with a plea to voters to focus on issues.</p> <p>President Obama, who has been saddled by association with Mrs. Clinton, who was serving him during the time she maintained her secret email server, did not respond to questions shouted by reporters Friday afternoon as he left the White House on a campaign trip to Florida to stump for Mrs. Clinton and Democratic Senate candidate Patrick Murphy.</p> <p>Briefing reporters on Air Force One, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said Mr. Obama President Obama expects the FBI to âfollow the facts wherever they leadâ and to act âirrespective of politics.â</p> <p>Mr. Schultz said the new email development does not affect Mr. Obamaâs support of Mrs. Clinton.</p> <p>Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson said on CNN, âObviously the FBI didnât do this lightly. There has to be something there.â</p> <p>He lamented the prospect of âa president-elect under criminal investigation.â</p> <p>âThatâs whatâs going to now be the case, if she is elected,â he said. âShe will control those jobs [in the Justice Department] that controls how this issue moves forward, which points to a special prosecutor. This is a mess. Itâs a mess. I think Trump is toast, so Hillary moving forward as president-elect? Four years of this? Ugh.â</p> <p>Congressional Republicans, who have been at odds with Mr. Trump on many issues, found common ground with their nominee in attacking Mrs. Clinton.</p> <p>âThis decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators,â said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.</p> <p>He again called for the Obama administration to suspend the classified intelligence briefings Mrs. Clinton is getting as the Democratic nominee.</p> <p>And Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, wondered whether the Justice Department will now convene a grand jury to pursue the case.</p> <p>He said the FBI had already cleared Mrs. Clinton of mishandling classified information, so to reopen the case suggests either potential new evidence of intent to mishandle secrets, or other potential criminal questions.</p> <p>âOriginally FBI focused on âclassification rulesâ and not broader issues related to government records/obstruction of justice. Will they now?â Mr. Cornyn tweeted.</p> <p>An FBI spokesman declined Friday to comment on the reopening of the investigation.</p> <p>The revelation that the investigation is continuing comes too late to affect the 16 million voters who have already cast ballots in absentee or in-person voting.</p> <p>Republicans have said Mrs. Clinton appeared to mislead Congress in her sworn testimony to the Benghazi probe in 2015.</p> <p>The staggering reversal by Mr. Comey comes as Mrs. Clinton is reeling from another electronic scandal â the revelations from emails obtained and posted by WikiLeaks from Mr. Podestaâs personal email address.</p> <p>Mrs. Clinton refused to use an official state.gov email account during her four years as secretary, instead setting up an account on a server she kept at her home in New York. That arrangement shielded her emails from public disclosure for six years, thwarting open-records laws.</p> <p>She belatedly turned over some 30,000 messages she deemed government-related, but the FBI recovered thousands of others she didnât â including some that contained classified information.</p>",Right,Center,Right,Right

General Jeff Sessions, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Joseph Dunford and Chief of Staff John Kelly were among the other officials present</p> <p>Reports of the caravan angered Trump, who has sent out a

Mexican officials on Monday: âI hope you're going to tell that caravan not to get up to the borderâ He added that he thinks the caravan was being broken up as a result</p> <p>The Pentagon was scrambling to come up with a response to Trump's statement on the military guarding the border But according to a memo obtained by Fox News and discussions with officials, one area w the Pentagon could contribute immediately is the Air Forceâs Barry Goldwater live-fire range, which shares a 35-mile border with Mexico in southern Arizona</p> <p>The Defense Department is already offering some support to the border, including US Navy ships patrolling waters to seize drugs as well as missions involving over 100 personnel from US militaryâs northern command -- including eight planes and a drone -- to help border patrol</p> <p>In 2010, President Obama authorized 1,200 National Guard troops to increase security at the border, although Republican lawmakers questioned their role and

cost approximately $20-25 billion In the omnibus bill signed by Trump last month, $16 billion was included for technology and some replacement of existing border fencing -- although it excluded the prototypes Trump recently viewed in California</p> <p>Trump briefly considered vetoing the legislation both over its lack of funding for the wall and also the failure to include a fix for the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that granted protection for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children He has since floated the idea of getting the Pentagon to fund the wall</p> <p>Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, said on Fox News Radioâs âThe Todd Starnes Showâ that it gives Border Patrol âcertainty of apprehensionâ</p>

Now theyâre scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as Secretary of State,â Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard who plans to announce her Republican presidential run May 4, wrote on her Facebook page.</p> <p>She continued: âThe American people will have a choice. Are we going to demand trust and transparency from our leaders? Have we had enough of a ruling political class that doles out favors to the wealthy and well connected few?â</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has tried to tamp down the controversy since it emerged this week in previews of the book âClinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.â</p> <p>The book, by conservative political adviser Peter Schweizer, argues that the Clintons got rich from speaking fees and donations in return for favors from Mrs. Clinton to various foreign interests while running the State Department.</p> <p>Other dealings include a free trade agreement in Colombia that benefited a major foundation donorâs investments in the South American nation, development projects in Haiti after a devastating earthquake in 2010, and more than $1 million in payments to Mr. Clinton by a Canadian bank and major shareholder in the Keystone XL oil pipeline that occurred while the project was under State Department review, according to reports.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign tried to dismiss the accusations as a right-wing âsmear project,â but that becomes increasingly difficult as mainstream news outlets pick up the story.</p> <p>Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon sent a memo Thursday to supporters and donors in an attempt to beat back the accusations.</p> <p>âThe bottom line remains that the book fails to produce a shred of evidence supporting the theory that Hillary Clinton ever took action as Secretary of State for the purposes of supporting the interests of donors to the Clinton foundation,â he wrote.</p> <p>At a campaign stop in New Hampshire this week, Mrs. Clinton brushed aside reportersâ questions about connections between contributions from foreign entities and her actions as secretary of state, calling them merely âdistractions and attacks.â</p> <p>âI know that that comes, unfortunately, with the territory,â she told The Associated Press.</p>",Right,Right,Right,Right

We are currently investigating and will provide more information shortly.â</p> <p>Rehkoff did not respond to HuffPostâs questions about whether Motel 6 condemned the employees actions â i.e., sharing guest information with ICE â or whether any staff members would face disciplinary actions.</p> <p>ICE agents have arrested at least 20 people who were staying at two Motel 6 locations in Phoenix, according to an investigative report published Wednesday by the Phoenix New Times. Employees at both motels told the weekly newspaper that they were sharing customersâ personal information with ICE on a regular basis.</p> <p>âWe send a report every morning to ICE â all the names of everybody that comes in,â an unidentified front-desk clerk explained to the New Times. âEvery morning at about 5 oâclock, we do the audit and we push a button and it sends it to ICE.â</p> <p>Staff at the Motel 6 on North Black Canyon Highway declined to answer questions from HuffPost about the New Times report and instead directed HuffPost to call its national media phone number. There was no answer at the Motel 6 on 52nd Drive; instead, HuffPost was automatically routed to a national Motel 6 reservation service.</p> <p>The New Times report revealed that, of the 20 arrests made at Motel 6 properties in Phoenix, one-third involved agents knocking on a suspectâs motel room door without a search warrant and asking for permission to enter.</p> <p>Yasmeen Pitts OâKeefe, a spokeswoman for ICEâs Phoenix division, told the New Times that these so-called âknock and talksâ were typical, but she would not reveal how the agency received the guest information, saying that they were confidential âinvestigative techniques.â</p> <p>Law enforcement officials are barred by a 2015 Supreme Court ruling from forcing hotels to turn in guest information, which may suggest that the Motel 6 employees had volunteered to work with ICE agents.</p> <p>Empowered by the Trump administration and President Donald Trumpâs promise to severely crack down on illegal immigration, ICE agents have ramped up efforts to arrest undocumented immigrants. In June, ICE Director Thomas Homan had warned that all undocumented immigrants âneed to be worriedâ and said that ICE would also go after non-criminal undocumented people. The agency âshouldnât play favorites,â he told the House Appropriations Committeeâs Homeland Security Subcommittee.</p> <p>And these efforts have seen results: Within Trumpâs first 100 days in office, the arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose nearly 40 percent.</p> <p>Phoenix attorney Robert McWhirter, whose client was arrested at a Motel 6 in June, told the New Times that reports of ICE agents knocking door-to-door for people who appeared to be Latino would raise concerns of racial profiling.</p> <p>âWe just donât know enough about whatâs going on,â he told the newspaper, adding, âIâll tell you one goddamned thing for sure â Iâm not staying at a Motel 6 from now on.â</p> <p>McWhirter isnât alone.

I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried,â he said in a statement Friday.</p> <p>âNor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which wonât be available by the end of the month, we wonât have reliable answers to any of those questions,â McCain said.</p> <p>The Arizona senator has been adamant all week that any major health care bill needs to go through regular order, which forces a bill to get 60 âyesâ votes and provides Democrats with the opportunity to filibuster.

3cd30542-ae56-4c0e-b6b7-e6acdcbe5de7,Paul Ryan: The Happy Warrior,Ryan RNC Speech,"<p>Paul Ryan at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, August 29, 2012.</p> <p>His conservative rallying cry is in the spirit of Kemp, Reagan, and Goldwater.</p> <p>Tampa, Fla. â The official line is that Paul Ryan spent two weeks preparing for his speech at the Republican National Convention. In the beginning, there were late-night chats about the theme with his speechwriters, John McConnell and Matthew Scully. Later came the practice sessions at a Holiday Inn Express in his hometown of Janesville, Wis., and in the final days, there were frantic editing sessions aboard the campaign plane and inside the Marriott hotel near the Tampa Bay Times Forum.</p> <p>But according to sources close to him, Ryan rarely sweated the preparation, even though his Wednesday-night appearance before the cheering throngs of Republican delegates was, in a sense, his national introduction. To the 42-year-old congressman, who was elected to the House in 1998, the speech was always a continuation of an argument he has made since he came to Washington, two decades ago, to write speeches for his mentor, Jack Kemp, the late supply-side Congressman.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Ryan has accomplished much since he was a twentysomething aide, and his adherence to conservative principles is, evidently, as strong as ever. He took care to cite Kemp tonight, in the biggest speech of his political career, to send a message about who Paul Ryan is as a thinker â to go beyond the anecdotes about his days flipping burgers at McDonaldâs or his recent efforts as chairman of the House Budget Committee.</p> <p>#ad#âAs with Kemp, Paul has always been a happy warrior, and he remains a happy warrior,â says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director. âDemocrats try to portray him as the austerity king, but he is a champion for growth.â</p> <p>Standing at the podium, Ryan ably weaved his biography and his political philosophy into a celebration of economic freedom and an articulation of the GOP ticketâs brand, which is a combination of competency and fiscal courage. âMy dad used to say to me, âSon, you have a choice. You can be part of the problem or you can be part of the solution,ââ Ryan said. âMitt Romney and I have made ours: Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nationâs economic problems.â</p> <p>âAnd Iâm going to level with you: We donât have that much time,â Ryan said, as the activists nodded. âBut if we are serious, and smart, and we lead, we can do this.â</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Since Romney tapped Ryan to be his running mate earlier this month, Ryan has worn many hats on the campaign trail, from attack dog to budget expert. And Wednesdayâs remarks had elements of all those roles. There were withering critiques of President Obamaâs economic record and a sober discussion about federal spending. Ryan, however, worked to personalize each passage. On Capitol Hill, he often sticks to data-heavy speeches on the House floor, which win plaudits from politicos, but here, speaking to the entire country, he painted his vision with broad strokes.</p> <p>âSo here we are, $16 trillion in debt and still [Obama] does nothing,â Ryan said. âThey have no answer to this simple reality: We need to stop spending money we donât have.â</p> <p>#page#Emotion was another component. Ryanâs mention of his motherâs example brought him to tears. âMom was 50 when my dad died,â he said. âShe got on a bus every weekday for years, and rode 40 miles each morning to Madison. She earned a new degree and learned new skills to start her small business. . . . And it transformed my mom from a widow in grief to a small businesswoman whose happiness wasnât just in the past. Her work gave her hope. It made our family proud. And to this day, my mom is my role model.â</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Ryan also sought a connection with youth voters. âCollege graduates should not have to live out their twenties in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life,â he said.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>âPaul Ryan was a shot in the arm,â says Ralph Reed, a veteran conservative activist, who appreciated Ryanâs reflections on the importance of family. âFor people who arenât familiar with everything he has done, he showed them that he is a full-spectrum conservative.â</p> <p>#ad#When he shifted to entitlements, the so-called third rail of American politics, Ryan talked again about his 78-year-old mother, who is a Florida resident and a Medicare beneficiary. And as he has on the trail, Ryan blasted Obama for using billions from Medicare funds to partially fund the federal health-care law.</p> <p>âOur opponents can consider themselves on notice,â Ryan said. âIn this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the Left isnât going to work. Mitt Romney and I know the difference between protecting a program and raiding it. Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate.â</p> <p>Part of the reason for the Ryan pick, one Romney adviser says, is Ryanâs ability to make reform understandable to average voters. And so, though it wasnât the heart of the speech, health care featured prominently.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>âObamacare comes to more than 2,000 pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees, and fines that have no place in a free country,â Ryan said. âThe president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over. That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal Obamacare.â</p> <p>Humor featured, too. Ryan mused that Romneyâs music tastes are similar to the tunes that are played in hotel elevators. âMy playlist starts with AC/DC and ends with Zeppelin,â he said, as the delegates chuckled.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Ryanâs speech, which was originally 4,400 words, was shortened to 3,200. Romneyâs advisers wanted to make sure Ryan did not go over the television networksâ time limit.</p> <p>But the word count and the jokes were not the story. At its core, Ryanâs rousing speech was a conservative rallying cry, very much in the tradition of Kemp, Ronald Reagan, and Barry Goldwater. Those men urged Americans to shrink government and empower individuals, and Ryan did just that in the arena by the bay, and he even harkened back to Reaganâs famous âtime for choosingâ speech in 1964.</p> <p>âYou are entitled to the clearest possible choice because the time for choosing is drawing near,â Ryan said near the end, his voice rising. âWe will not try to replace our founding principles, we will reapply our founding principles. The work ahead will be hard. These times demand the best of us, all of us, but we can do this.â</p> <p>â Robert Costa is a political reporter for National Review.</p>",Right,Right,Right,Right

40a2913d-3b74-4a3a-848a-38a9cbe8adc7,Paul Ryanâs Large Lies and One Big Truth,Ryan RNC Speech,"<p>Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/2012 AFP</p> <p>Amidst the vast plumes of rhetorical homages to freedom and entrepreneurship and the evils of central planning, there was but one small moment in Paul Ryanâs speech when he actually spelled out what his abstract rhetorical formulations really mean. It came when he assailed President Obama for cutting Medicare â cuts that Ryan now finds unconscionable but had proposed to maintain until a few weeks ago, but never mind â for what he called âa new entitlement we didnât even ask for.â</p> <p>This is actually true â one of the few clear truths in a speech sorely lacking them. But what does this mean?</p> <p>Obama was indeed trying to turn access to health insurance into an entitlement. Ryan and his fellow Republicans have made various gestures toward the notion of some kind of plan of their own to provide access to health insurance for people who canât afford it, but they have never been willing to devote the necessary resources. Here was Ryan actually assailing not the method but the goal, implicitly conceding his position that health insurance is not an entitlement but a nice thing everybody would like but not everybody can have, like a beach house.</p> <p>The political logic embedded in Ryanâs formulation was even more telling. He dismissed the goal of providing health insurance to those who canât afford it as something âwe didnât even ask for.â Who is âweâ? We is the majority of Americans who do have health insurance. We outnumber the 50 million who donât. They can go screw themselves. Ryan actually called Obamaâs decision to cut what he deemed wasteful spending in Medicare to cover the uninsured his âcoldest power play.â It is a cold power play to give medical care to people who canât get it, and an act of compassion to take it away from them.</p> <p>The political blogosphere has taken apart Ryanâs brazen dishonesty brick by brick so that barely anything remains. I have been writing about his dishonesty for three years. I have the equivalent of a masterâs degree in Ryan lie-ology. Iâve heard many of his lurid fantasies innumerable times and I havenât got it in me to go through it all again â his deep dishonesty largely reflects the fundamental gap between the radicalism of his agenda and his need for public acceptance. Iâll merely point out that, even if all the smaller component dishonesties of Ryanâs speech were true, the larger points they undergirded were false as well.</p> <p>Ryan began by castigating Obama for borrowing money to fund a stimulus. He then castigated Obama for making his âfirst order of businessâ the passage of health-care reform rather than economic rescue, when Ryan himself had just told the audience that the first thing Obama had done was actually to pass a plan intended to rescue the economy. Having argued that Obama erred by distracting himself with health care rather than devote all his energies to the recovery, Ryan immediately promised he and Romney would repeal Obamacare â wouldnât that also possibly distract from their own economic focus?</p> <p>In the same vein, Ryan told unemployed Americans, âif youâre feeling passed by, you have not failed, your leaders have failed youâ â and then, moments later, sneered that Obama saw economically struggling Americans as âvictims of circumstances beyond our control.â Ryan believes fervently that Obamaâs failures are the sole exception to the general rule that individuals are the masters of their own economic fate. To bolster his claim that people move in and out of economic classes constantly without government intervention, Ryan described a few menial short-term jobs he had performed in his early years, boasting, âI never thought of myself as stuck in some station in lifeâ â as if, but for his own gumption and elbow grease, the heir to one of the richest families in his town was really at risk of staying in his summer lawn-mowing job forever.</p> <p>At the political level, Ryanâs notion of responsibility beggars belief. Under the Bush administration, Republicans â with Ryanâs support and often active leadership â systematically destroyed the fiscal position of the federal government. They voted for large tax cuts, a new entitlement, wars, and twice repealed pay-as-you-go budget rules that would have required them to pay for all these things. As a result, when Obama took office at the outset of the economic crisis, he inherited an annual deficit of well over a trillion dollars.</p> <p>Obama tried on numerous occasions to craft bipartisan agreements to reduce the long-term debt. Ryan, using the enormous intra-party influence he had amassed, crushed those agreements at every turn. Ryan voted against the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission, killing its prospects. To complete the dishonesty, Ryan referred to the debt commission he served on and helped kill as âthey,â not âwe.â (Ryanâs defenders sometimes assert that he only voted against the plan because it failed to include privatized Medicare, but in fact Ryan opposed a compromise that would do that, as well.) Ryan killed a bipartisan Senate plan and also killed a negotiated debt settlement between Obama and John Boehner.</p> <p>Part of Ryanâs logic at the time (according to two sources, one in each party) was that signing a deal âwould pave the way for Mr. Obamaâs easy reelection.â This was a plausible calculation â agreeing to a deficit compromise would have made it hard for Republicans to run against Obama as a left-wing spendthrift. And here was Ryan last night, running against Obama as a left-wing spendthrift, precisely as his own strategy enabled.</p> <p>Incredibly, the larger theme of Ryanâs speech was to assail Obama for failing to take full responsibilities for this state of affairs â Obama is âshifting blame,â âblaming others.â It is the single largest motif of Ryanâs speech. Letâs review: Ryan helps to create a massive structural deficit, repeatedly and almost single-handedly prevents a solution, then runs for vice-president, blaming Obama for the structural deficit and further blaming him for his unwillingness to agree that this is all his own fault. The really amazing thing is that it could possibly work.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

437793e0-311e-4b6c-9f52-4622b5cdff22,Ryan and His Panicky Critics,Ryan RNC Speech,"<p>The presidentâs apologists correctly sense peril for their favored candidate.</p> <p>Paul Ryanâs speech accepting the Republican partyâs nomination for vice president was everything that could have been hoped for by the Romney campaign and more. It made the case against President Obama in devastating terms â using humor and memorable line after memorable line to drive home the main point that the president has been a miserable failure in office. The speech is likely to have lasting impact in this campaign.</p> <p>Which perhaps explains the panicky reaction of the mainstream press and Ryanâs liberal critics. Almost from the moment Ryan finished his speech, apologists for the president (including the Washington Post) have come out swinging, quite plainly indignant that Ryan landed so many punches when the usual media filters couldnât stop him.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#ad#And, so, not surprisingly, these same apologists have resorted to the usual kind of smear tactics â accusing Ryan of offering up misleading arguments and even âlies.â</p> <p>These criticisms of Ryanâs speech are absurd. Everything Ryan said is factual and a fair reading of the record and prior events.</p> <p>Letâs start with Medicare. Ryanâs critics are beside themselves that the Romney campaign has effectively pinned $716 billion in Medicare cuts on the Obama administration. Two arguments are made to defend the president. First, it is said that Ryanâs own budget cut Medicare by the same amount. But the Ryan budget not only repealed all of Obamacareâs spending, it also doesnât specify the kinds of Medicare cuts Obamacare does: It calls for the same level of savings but doesnât spend the money elsewhere and leaves room for Congress to pursue those savings in ways that donât rely on price controls and the elimination of benefits. Moreover, both Romney and Ryan have said that they, in a Romney administration, would meet their budgetary goals without Obamacareâs Medicare cuts by trimming elsewhere in the budget. And it is certainly the case that Romney and Ryan will have much greater flexibility than Ryan did as House Budget Committee chairman to make cuts wherever they can find them.</p> <p>Ryanâs critics also take exception to the implication that the Medicare âcutsâ will do any harm to the health care provided to seniors, arguing that the savings come from âtargeted cuts to providers,â not seniors. This is utter nonsense. Among the cuts in Obamacare is a deep and permanent reduction in payments to Medicare Advantage plans. According to the Medicare trustees, that cut will force 4 million seniors out of their Medicare Advantage plans. There is no question that these seniors will lose thousands of dollars per year in health benefits because of these cuts. Moreover, the chief actuary for the Medicare program has projected that, by the end of this decade, 15 percent of facilities will have to stop taking Medicare patients because of Obamacareâs cuts. That will directly impair access to care for millions of seniors, and the percentage of hospitals and nursing homes dropping out of Medicare will grow to 25 percent by 2030.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Ryanâs critics are also up in arms over his mention of the closed GM plant in Janesville, Wis. They claim that Ryan blamed President Obama for the closing of the plant â but Ryan explicitly said that the plant was already closing when then-candidate Obama came to Janesville in 2008: âWe were about to lose a major factory,â Ryan said last night. Second, it is worth recalling that Obama, in a June 2008 statement, said that, if elected president, he would âlead an effort to retool plants like the GM facility in Janesville.â This is further confirmation of Ryanâs point that Obama essentially promised to find a way to keep the plant open after he became president â and did not deliver.</p> <p>But letâs step back and look at Ryanâs larger point. He was making the argument that, even with the Obama bailout, the Obama economy is so bad that the plant is still closed and, whatâs worse, thereâs no prospect that other vibrant industries will take its place. Thatâs absolutely a fair indictment of the Obama record, especially so because Obama went to the plant and promised hope and change in 2008.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#page#Then there is the business of the U.S. credit downgrade and the Bowles-Simpson commission. In his speech, Ryan properly excoriated the president for his profligate spending and for his indifference to the nationâs debt crisis. During the presidentâs term, the national debt will rise by more than $5 trillion. Ryan pinned S&Pâs decision to lower the credit rating for debt issued by the U.S. government on the presidentâs failure to lead on fiscal matters, and chastised him specifically for appointing the Bowles-Simpson commission and then doing nothing with the commissionâs recommendations. Ryanâs critics say he is being hypocritical because Ryan himself also opposed the Bowles-Simpson recommendations.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>But when Ryan opposed that plan (because it left in place Obamacareâs massive new entitlement spending), he proposed an alternative and passed it through the House of Representatives. What did President Obama do? Nothing. He appointed the commission to buy time during the 2010 campaign season, and then, in 2011, decided that leading on the deficit wasnât in his political interest. So he proposed no plan of his own. And then when Ryan proposed his plan to actually head off a fiscal crisis, the president attacked it in the most partisan and demagogic terms possible. Is it any surprise, with this kind of behavior from the president, that the parties werenât able to come to an amicable agreement? Any fair reading of the record shows that the president has abdicated his leadership responsibilities on fiscal matters. He richly deserves the blame for the downgrade.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#ad#Finally, Ryanâs critics cannot stomach the fact that Ryan refuses to play along with their caricatures of him as an uncaring Randian, obsessed with individualism and indifferent to the needs of the vulnerable. In his speech, Ryan specifically noted that a society should be measured by how well the strong protect the weak. Thatâs entirely consistent with the budget plan he favors. As usual, his critics want the world to equate more governmental programs and spending with improvement in the lives of the poor. And yet, after trillions in spending, poverty and dependence are on the rise under President Obama.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Under Romney and Ryan, there will be plenty of room for generous government spending on a safety net for those who are truly incapable of taking care of themselves. Thatâs as it should be. But what the poor really need is opportunity, for better-paying jobs and mobility up the wage scale. There is a mountain of evidence that what will help the poor more than anything else is a vibrant free-market economy. Moreover, the reason welfare reform was such a success in 1996 was not that it limited government spending (although it did do that) but that it improved the lives of millions of lower-income American families by emphasizing work over dependence. Thatâs a lesson that Ryanâs critics, the president included, still have not learned.</p> <p>Paul Ryanâs acceptance speech was a tour de force, and a clear success. One measure of that success is the intensity and emptiness of the attacks coming his way. The irony is that these attacks â intended to damage Ryan by undermining his credibility â are more likely to be seen by the electorate for what they really are: desperate and dishonest tactics from those willing to say and do anything to hang on to power.</p> <p>â James C.

44baead2-f908-4da8-bf69-96cf06dc00fe,Paul Ryanâs speech in 3 words,Ryan RNC Speech,"<p>1. Dazzling</p> <p>At least a quarter of Americans still donât know who Paul Ryan is, and only about half who know and have an opinion of him view him favorably.</p> <p>So, Ryanâs primary job tonight was to introduce himself and make himself seem likeable, and he did that well. The personal parts of the speech were very personally delivered, especially the touching parts where Ryan talked about his father and mother and their roles in his life. And at the end of the speech, when Ryan cheered the crowd to its feet, he showed an energy and enthusiasm thatâs what voters want in leaders and what Republicans have been desperately lacking in this campaign.</p> <p>To anyone watching Ryanâs speech who hasnât been paying much attention to the ins and outs and accusations of the campaign, I suspect Ryan came across as a smart, passionate and all-around nice guy â the sort of guy you can imagine having a friendly chat with while watching your kids play soccer together. And for a lot of voters, what matters isnât what candidates have done or what they promise to do âitâs personality. On this measure, Mitt Romney has been catastrophically struggling and with his speech, Ryan humanized himself and presumably by extension, the top of the ticket.</p> <p>2. Deceiving</p> <p>On the other hand, to anyone paying the slightest bit of attention to facts, Ryanâs speech was an apparent attempt to set the world record for the greatest number of blatant lies and misrepresentations slipped into a single political speech. On this measure, while it was Romney who ran the Olympics, Ryan earned the gold.</p> <p>The good news is that the Romney-Ryan campaign has likely created dozens of new jobs among the legions of additional fact checkers that media outlets are rushing to hire to sift through the mountain of cow dung that flowed from Ryanâs mouth. Said fact checkers have already condemned certain arguments that Ryan still irresponsibly repeated.</p> <p>Fact: While Ryan tried to pin the downgrade of the United Statesâ credit rating on spending under President Obama, the credit rating was actually downgraded because Republicans threatened not to raise the debt ceiling.</p> <p>Fact: While Ryan blamed President Obama for the shut down of a GM plant in Janesville, Wisconsin, the plant was actually closed under President George W. Bush. Ryan actually asked for federal spending to save the plant, while Romney has criticized the auto industry bailout that President Obama ultimately enacted to prevent other plants from closing.</p> <p>Fact: Though Ryan insisted that President Obama wants to give all the credit for private sector success to government, that isn't what the president said. Period.</p> <p>Fact: Though Paul Ryan accused President Obama of taking $716 billion out of Medicare, the fact is that that amount was savings in Medicare reimbursement rates (which, incidentally, save Medicare recipients out-of-pocket costs, too) and Ryan himself embraced these savings in his budget plan.</p> <p>Elections should be about competing based on your record in the past and your vision for the future, not competing to see who can get away with the most lies and distortions without voters noticing or bother to care. Both parties should hold themselves to that standard. Republicans should be ashamed that there was even one misrepresentation in Ryanâs speech but sadly, there were many.</p> <p>3. Distracting</p> <p>And then thereâs what Ryan didnât talk about.</p> <p>Ryan didnât mention his extremist stance on banning all abortions with no exception for rape or incest, a stance that is out of touch with 75% of American voters.</p> <p>Ryan didnât mention his previous plan to hand over Social Security to Wall Street.</p> <p>Ryan didnât mention his numerous votes to raise spending and balloon the deficit when George W. Bush was president.</p> <p>Ryan didnât mention how his budget would eviscerate programs that help the poor and raise taxes on 95% of Americans in order to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires even further and increase â yes, increase âthe deficit.</p> <p>These aspects of Ryanâs resume and ideology are sticky to say the least. He would have been wise to tackle them head on and try and explain them away in his first real introduction to voters.

Many publications have noted that this likely means the bill is dead and will not move forward. McCain said in a statement that he, ""cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,"" as it had not gone through a bipartisan, rigorous debate process.","<p>One talking point in the debate over the Graham-Cassidy health-care bill is that it would systematically discriminate against Democratic states and in favor of Republican ones: Rand Paul told reporters on Tuesday that his colleagues are âtaking the Obamacare money, keeping it, and taking it from Democratic states and giving it to Republican states.â Thatâs not quite accurate.</p> <p>Three analyses of the bill, from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Avalere, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, have found that the change in federal health-care funding would be negative for states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Among those states are Republican strongholds Arizona, Louisiana, Arkansas, Ohio, and Kentucky. The states that would benefit from the bill are states that did not expand Medicaid, which makes sense given its funding formula. To be sure, most of those states tend to vote Republican, but Paul asserted a cut-and-dry reality that is not the case. Reality is more complicated than pithy talking points can make it seem.</p>",Right,Center,Right,Right
45bb966d-3fdb-4c58-873a-9ec113531f94,Red State Democrats Oppose Republican Effort To Defund Obamacare,GOP Fighting Obamacare,"<p>WASHINGTON -- While pushing an effort to defund Obamacare or risk a government shutdown, congressional Republicans have insisted they might have some unlikely allies on their side: Senate Democrats up for reelection in red states.</p> <p>But at least two of those Democrats, Sens. Mark Begich (Alaska) and Mark Pryor (Ark.), laughed off the suggestion Thursday that they would vote for a continuing resolution that permanently strips the Affordable Care Act of its funding.</p> <p>""We're not going through another [vote to repeal Obamacare], 43rd or 44th -- no,"" Begich told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""Do I have issues with Obamacare? Yes. We've proposed multiple amendments and ideas to fix it, to make it better and take out things that aren't working ... but we're not going through this process.""</p> <p>When The Huffington Post asked Begich to respond to the idea that Democrats facing tough reelection battles in conservative states might favor House Republicans' strategy, which ties Obamacare funding to a continuing resolution to keep the government running past Sept. 30, Begich laughed and shook his head.</p> <p>""No -- I think those guys over there should focus on what the American people want, and that is a budget done,"" he said. ""Quit playing with the continuing resolution, putting the debt at risk, and causing this great economy that's moved in the right direction to falter again.""</p> <p>Pryor also told HuffPost he didn't favor the approach. ""No, I just don't,"" he responded with a smile.</p> <p>""We voted on Obamacare ... and it's the law of the land. It's been through the Supreme Court,"" Pryor said. ""It's not perfect, but let's work to make it better.""</p> <p>Begich and Pryor, along with Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), are all up for reelection next year in states that President Barack Obama lost in 2012. They've faced a multitude of attacks over Obamacare, with Republicans looking to seize on any delays or roadblocks in the law's implementation.</p> <p>Hagan spokeswoman Sadie Weiner confirmed to HuffPost that the North Carolina senator would not vote for a continuing resolution that defunds Obamacare. Landrieu spokesman Matthew Lehner said in an email that the senator ""will not vote for a continuing resolution that defunds the Affordable Care Act.""</p> <p>Some Republicans have nonetheless spent days prophesying that red state Democrats are so vulnerable, they might buck their own president on his signature health care law.</p> <p>""I think if we get this bill out of the House and over to the Senate it'll be political suicide for the Democrats in red states that are up for election in the Senate,"" Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) told The Hill on Tuesday. ""That's why I think we should send it over there and let them vote on it.""</p> <p>Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas) echoed a similar view Wednesday when asked how Republicans could muster enough votes to defund Obamacare in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p> <p>""I want to see Mark Pryor vote on it,"" he told HuffPost. ""I think people like [Pryor's GOP Senate opponent, Rep.] Tom Cotton and all their future opponents think this is a great thing politically.""</p> <p>Unfortunately for Huelskamp, that vote may never happen. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) can strip out the provision that defunds Obamacare with a simple majority vote and, once the upper chamber passes a revised bill to keep the government funded, put the ball back in House GOP leadership's court.</p> <p>Even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), one of the main proponents of the plan in the Senate, conceded there weren't enough votes in the upper chamber for it to be successful, and his colleagues seem far from eager to put up a fight. A number of Senate Republicans have continued to criticize the House GOP's plan; their skepticism only mounted on Thursday.</p> <p>""Everybody knows we can't win this fight. That's the problem,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told reporters.</p> <p>""I oppose Obamacare as much as anybody in the Senate, but it's just difficult for me to see how this leads us anywhere but a boxed canyon,"" said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).</p> <p>This post has been updated to include comment from Landrieu's spokesman.</p> <p>Correction: This story has been corrected to reflect that Sadie Weiner is a spokeswoman for Sen. Kay Hagan, not Sen. Mary Landrieu, and to clarify Hagan's position on a continuing resolution that defunds Obamacare.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

497c489d-0250-45af-8e59-18d69b081641,Here's why progressives hate Betsy DeVos,"Betsy DeVos has come under criticism for her Sunday interview on '60 Minutes', where some say she struggled to answer Lesley Stahl's questions and provide sufficient evidence that her school choice initiatives have been effective.","<p>After Education Secretary Betsy DeVosâs appearance on CBSâs â60 Minutesâ on Sunday night, progressive media outlets and personalities mocked her performance as âtrainwreckâ saying that she âstumbled,â âstruggled,â and âstunk upâ the interview.</p> <p>Although Secretary DeVos did struggle to answer some questions on the spot, the substance and tone of the criticisms are inaccurate and unfair.</p> <p>None of this should be surprising. Secretary DeVos, a Christian grandmother and philanthropist who has spent her career trying to improve the quality of education for poor children, has been criticized and mocked relentlessly. And she is the only Cabinet secretary who travels with a cadre of U. S. Marshals because of death threats sheâs received.</p> <p>So why, as â60 Minutesââ Lesley Stahl put it, has Secretary DeVos become the âmost hated Cabinet secretary?â</p> <p>One reasonâas opinion pieces in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have arguedâis that some of the Democratic partyâs most deep-pocketed and powerful interest groups are teachersâ unions who realize that they will no longer have a near-monopoly on education.</p> <p>Another reason, as the New York Timesâ Ross Douthat argued, is that the Democratic partyâs upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency - who are big supporters, in theory, of public education â bristle at the idea of DeVosâ charters and vouchers being attractive to poor and minority families (who in their view belong in public schools) or families with ideological or religious convictions that differ from their own.</p> <p>On second thought, I guess itâs not so hard to understand why the leftâs hard-core education bureaucracy is so opposed to her. She is a serious threat to the status quo that has served them â if not students â so well.</p> <p>Perhaps the most significant reason, however, is the one Secretary DeVos gave in response to Stahlâs question: more than anything else, she is misunderstood.</p> <p>To clear up any misunderstanding caused by the leftâs holy war against her, here are four things Americans should understand about Secretary DeVosâ educational vision:</p> <p>First, as she noted in the â60 Minutesâ interview, Secretary DeVos wants to liberate American education from encroachment by federal bureaucracy. Under the Obama administration, the federal government functioned as a giant octopus, bypassing families, communities, and states in order to reach its tentacles into school curriculum, teacher evaluation, values conformity, and even restroom policies. Betsy DeVos signals a departure from that era. Her stated educational philosophy suggests that she will not turn Democratic encroachment into Republican encroachment; instead, she will reduce federal encroachment in order to empower families, local communities, and states.</p> <p>Second, Secretary DeVos emphasizes freedom of thought. During her confirmation hearings, the media made much ado about her âDutch Calvinistâ religious views. But Dutch Calvinism is a rich religious tradition that emphasizes the rights and freedoms of families, communities, and religions. For that reason, it finds adherents on the right and on the left. Additionally, it places an especially high value on education, but emphasizes that a plural society should be tolerant enough to allow diverse families and communities to build their own educational institutions and choose which institution(s) their children can attend. Unfortunately, many liberal educators are quite illiberal, unwilling to tolerate any type of educational diversity that undermines the federal governmentâs impulse toward command-and-control.</p> <p>Third, she wants to empower financially-disadvantaged families to send their children to whichever school they deem best. Under the current system, the government taxes citizens in order to provide education, but then dictates and determines how the tax money can be used. The message is clear: the federal governmentârather than the family or local communityâis responsible for shaping the way a child understands and interprets the world.</p> <p>Under Secretary DeVosâ system of vouchers and charters, however, citizens will be able to exercise more influence over their own childâs education. They will also be able to send their children to a wider variety of schools, including those that would have been financially prohibitive without the vouchers. This sort of system is supported by prominent intellectuals and educators such as Anthony Bradley and has been supported in the past by Democratic politicians such as Cory Booker.</p> <p>Fourth, Secretary Devos does not come to her job as a career politician or an educational ideologue. She comes as a lifelong education advocate and philanthropist who has given tens of millions of dollars to public and private educational institutions.</p> <p>As her â60 Minutesâ interview made clear, Secretary DeVos is an imperfect Secretary of Education, as all secretaries of education have been. She is neither a career politician nor a pundit.</p> <p>What she is is a skilled educational advocate and a lifelong educational philanthropist whose vision for education could reduce bureaucracy, increase free thinking, and empower the financially disadvantaged, thus helping children to get the education they deserve.</p> <p>On second thought, I guess itâs not so hard to understand why the leftâs hard-core education bureaucracy is so opposed to her. She is a serious threat to the status quo that has served them â if not students â so well.</p> <p>Good-thinking Americans on the left and right should reject the mainstream media narrative and pull for Secretary DeVos as she tries to reform and shake up these aspects of our nationsâ educational system.</p>",Right,Right,Right,Right

5693a6f3-e4b1-4c03-aeb6-0b68d9191465,Sessions Recuses Himself But Still Dodges Questions,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice last year with the top Russian diplomat in Washington whose interactions with President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Flynn's firing. Sessions did not mention either meeting during his confirmation hearings. A Justice official said Sessions didn't mislead senators during his confirmation, since he was asked about communication between Russia and the Trump campaign - not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.","<p>Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images</p> <p>As he signaled he would probably do earlier today amidst the explosive revelation of two meetings he held with Russiaâs ambassador to the U.S. during the presidential campaign, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced he would recuse himself from any Justice Department investigation of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials or agents. Indeed, the recusal will extend to investigations of any issues related to the 2016 election, though it is hard to imagine any issue eclipsing this one in significance. It is also worth noting the recusal only extends to events occurring before Election Day, which means Sessions could involve himself in a probe of alleged contacts occurring between November 8 and today.</p> <p>At a brief press conference announcing the step, Sessions claimed this decision had already been made and was well in the works before news broke of his meetings with the ambassador. And he also denied any wrongdoing or impropriety in negatively answering questions during his confirmation hearings about interactions with Russians. He is taking the very hard line that all he was asked about was contacts made with him as a Trump surrogate. Since the alleged meetings were, he said, held with him in his capacity as a U.S. Senator, they were not relevant to the questions.</p> <p>In a rather casual description of the one meeting with Sergey Kislyak that seemed to be substantial, Sessions made it sound like a social call or even an effort by the Russian to collect political gossip. While he has adamantly stated the meeting was not on behalf of the Trump campaign, he would not rule out the possibility the campaign came up, it being such a hot topic, doncha know. This gives Sessions a prearranged second line of defense if someone else in the meeting suggests the campaign was discussed after all.</p> <p>While Sessions constantly denied he had done anything wrong, he did at the very end of his press conference allow that he should have probably mentioned the meetings when Al Franken asked him at the confirmation hearing about contacts with Russians. His explanation for not doing so was that he was âtaken abackâ by this line of questioning. To hear Sessions talk now, the idea of Russians interfering with the presidential election on Trumpâs behalf was a new one to him when he held the meeting in September and when he was asked about meetings in January of this year. Since Hillary Clinton made global headlines by accusing the Russians of interference immediately before the September meeting, this hardly seems credible.</p> <p>But thatâs his story and heâs sticking to it. Absent new evidence, we can expect Republicans in Congress, if not Democrats, to call the recusal enough and shift attention from Sessions to the broader investigation, or try to bury the whole thing. But as with his decision not to disclose the meetings in January, Sessionsâs reputation as a straight shooter is taking a big hit. Once again, heâs splitting hairs like a shady lawyer instead of living up to his responsibilities as chief law-enforcement officer of the United States.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left
56ff2801-dffa-41dc-b405-a796b4a7d782,The Latest Phase of the Clinton Email Brouhaha Wonât Save Trump,"On Friday, the FBI announced that it has now reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server after discoveries it made from its investigation of Congressman Anthony Weiner's activities.","<p>Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</p> <p>I donât know what is contained in the emails allegedly found on Anthony Weinerâs electronic device, which occasioned the âreviewâ and the heads-up the FBI felt constrained to give Republican committee chairmen in Congress 11 days before a general election. Neither do you. So any hard predictions of what the incident might mean politically are simply not in order.</p> <p>Assuming there is nothing literally incriminating in the emails (or nothing that will come out before Election Day, anyway), the scariest thing for the Clinton campaign involves the conventional wisdom that the candidate who can best avoid media attention down the stretch is likeliest to win. In a contest where both candidates are unpopular, the reasoning goes, you donât want voters to head to the polls freshly reminded of what they most dislike about you. The final week or so of the campaign looked like it would be dominated by ever-more-shrill statements by Donald Trump about rigged elections and the women peddling âfakeâ accusations of sexual misconduct against him. The spotlight had largely focused away from Clinton, aside from thoughts about the prospect of her breaking the glass ceiling, which even a fair number of the people intending to vote against her might appreciate. Thatâs now changed, for the moment at least.</p> <p>But the underlying âstoryâ of the emails isnât some sort of bombshell, and the odds are that the negative attention and any lingering substantive concerns among voters will be too little, too late to make much of a difference.</p> <p>As Nate Silver points out in a very clear-eyed reaction to todayâs news, the original Comey press conference on the emails, which was mainly reported as a stern official confirmation of very bad behavior by Clinton, only cost her about two points in the polls. Itâs hard to imagine an echo of that bad story for Clinton having a greater impact, particularly with early voting already underway and the number of undecided voters steadily declining. But in any event, she could probably weather a two-point drop in support right now.</p> <p>On the other hand, the new email story â unless the FBI or press leaks take the air out of it right away â is a heaven-sent opportunity for the Trump campaign to convince its supporters he can still win, and that his ranting and raving about Clintonâs supposed criminality is being vindicated. It wonât get him 270 electoral votes, but it could boost Republican turnout enough to make a difference in down-ballot races, and maybe make the evening of November 8 suspenseful, even if fears of voting-machine hacks or Trumpian violence prove fanciful.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

At State, Pagliano carried the title of special advisor and deputy chief information officer. He earned approximately $140,000 a year as a GS-15, The Daily Caller found. (RELATED: How Much Was Hillaryâs Personal IT Guy Paid At The State Department?)</p> <p>Earlier this week, Paglianoâs attorney, Mark Macdougall, informed the House Select Committee on Benghazi that his client will plead the fifth if subpoenaed to testify about his involvement in the email setup. According to The Post, a spokeswoman for the Senate Judiciary Committee said that Pagliano made the decision not to testify after his attorney told him he could be asked questions about outside employment. (RELATED: Hillaryâs IT Guy Says Heâll Plead The Fifth If Called To Testify About Home-Brew Server)</p> <p>The committees are reportedly considering granting Pagliano immunity, a move that would compel him to testify.</p> <p>The State Department initially said that there was no evidence that Pagliano was paid on the side to operate Clintonâs server. Early last month after Paglianoâs role was revealed, an official told The Post that the agency âfound no evidence that he ever informed the department that he had outside income.â</p> <p>This week, State declined to discuss Paglianoâs arrangement, citing âongoing reviews and investigations.â</p> <p>The FBI is currently investigating Clintonâs server, which had been relocated from New York to a New Jersey data center after she left the State Department.

64d628b6-00bd-4669-8f8f-90295dc63cc9,"What The âDuck Dynastyâ Scandal Tells Us About Race, Homophobia, And The Media ",Duck Dynasty Bigotry Controversy,"<p>Yesterday, Phil Robertson, the star of A&E;âs massively popular reality show Duck Dynasty, about a family that made a fortune selling duck calls to hunters, followed whatâs now become a familiar cycle. He was quoted saying any number of intolerant things in a profile by Drew Magary in GQ, condemned by GLAAD, and swiftly suspended by his network for an indefinite period of time. The Duck Dynasty story has gone wider than this type of cycle normally extends, with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, normally a supporter of free enterprise, complaining that Robertsonâs suspension is an example of how far our society has fallen from First Amendment principles. But variations aside, the Robertson kerfuffle is the perfect scandal with which to end our year in popular culture for what it tells about the lines reality television tries â and increasingly fails â to walk, who has power to marginalize political ideas in popular culture, and how conservatives will try to defend the holdouts theyâve carved out for themselves in mass media.</p> <p>The most revealing thing about Robertsonâs remarks about homosexuality in GQ is really the extent to which his comments about homosexuality are on-brand for A&E.; Jase Robertson told Magary that the three things his family wanted their show to be about were âfaith, betrayal of family members, and duck season.â As is clear in the profile in GQ, A&E; has tried to walk a fine line between portraying the Robertsons as religious Christians without spotlighting the parts of their beliefs that have the potential to cause precisely the kind of firestorm that resulted yesterday. âThere are more things Phil would like to say â âcontroversialâ things, as he puts it to me â that donât make the cut,â Magary writes. This dilemma of wanting part of a reality television cast memberâs personality, but only the parts that will make you money, is one that faced CBSâs Big Brother this year, too, after discovering that the ways in which a number of their controversial and colorful cast members were controversial and colorful was that they were enormously ignorant racists.</p> <p>I absolutely understand the desire to make money off of either evangelical Christianity or American backwardness, which has increasingly been one of the staples of reality television. There is clearly a market for an underserved audience of religious Christians who would like to see themselves reflected in popular media more frequently. And there is clearly a market for being horrified by other peopleâs behavior. But it is exceptionally difficult, in a reality television context, to separate out and wall off the part of someoneâs personality that is attractive and media-friendly from the parts that are less palatable to a mass audience. If youâre writing fiction for television, those attributes can get shaved off by the collective process of the writersâ room. But if you are, yourself, a reality television product, especially if you feel like youâre being suppressed or misrepresented, those parts of your personality and beliefs will inevitably out. Sometimes, the surprises are pleasant, as was the case on Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, where a family offered up as backwards and repellent proved to be tolerant, loving, and charming. But that is not often the case.</p> <p>For the most part, reality television producers and the networks that air their work, have decided that these outbursts are worth the risk of continuing to sell highly specific personalities, precisely because the cycle of suspension, response, and temporary profit loss are so well-established at this point that it can probably be worked into a budget. I canât imagine anyone at A&E; is surprised that someone like Phil Robertson, who bills himself as a Bible-believing evangelical, believes that you can âStart with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,â or that he would say something like âIt seems like, to me, a vagina â as a man â would be more desirable than a manâs anus. Thatâs just me. Iâm just thinking: Thereâs more there! Sheâs got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what Iâm saying? But hey, sin: Itâs not logical, my man. Itâs just not logical.â The question was probably when, not if.</p> <p>And when that when arrived, A&E; had a well road-tested formula to use in its response, provided by the folks at GLAAD. GLAAD is the most effective media advocacy organization that I know of, on two levels: first, its ability to swiftly identify and condemn anti-LGBT speech and to get results, and second, in its deep, comprehensive, and intersectional research on the depiction of LGBT characters and figures in media. When Robertsonâs remarks broke, Wilson Cruz of GLAAD responded quickly with a statement that hit on an incredible number of ideas in a clear, efficient way.</p> <p>âPhil and his family claim to be Christian, but Philâs lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe,â he said. âHe clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of Louisianans â and Americans â who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples. Philâs decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E; and his sponsors, who now need to re-examine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT people and families.â It was a condemnation that positioned GLAAD as a more sophisticated and compassionate arbiter of Christian values than Robertson, drew a connection between culture and legal protection, and offered a reminder that GLAAD has plenty of experience influencing media sponsors.</p> <p>And A&E; knew immediately what it had to do to respond to GLAAD: Robertson was suspended for an indefinite period of time, a punishment that doesnât just promise long-running financial losses to him, but because it has no end point, canât be immediately decried as too short or too long. Itâs action that effectively ends the news cycle, as far as A&E;âs need to take action and appear responsive are concerned.</p> <p>Itâs also worth noting that because of GLAADâs swift intervention, much of the media coverage has focused more on Robertsonâs anti-gay remarks than his comments about African Americans and the Civil Rights movement, which werenât worked into the narrative of the profile, but appeared as a pull quote in the online version of the piece. While Robertsonâs views on homosexuality are presented as consistent with his religious beliefs, his remarks about African-Americans are actually more politically extreme, aimed at undermining the validity of the safety net.</p> <p>âI never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. Iâm with the blacks, because weâre white trash. Weâre going across the field,â Robertson said. âTheyâre singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, âI tell you what: These doggone white peopleâ â not a word!â¦ Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.â</p> <p>Thatâs a vision of the American South and American racial history thatâs in keeping with Paula Deenâs alleged plantation nostalgia. Itâs an attempt to substitute Robertsonâs own memories of his interactions with African American laborers, whose behavior around him may well have been influenced by his relative privilege as a white man, even a poor one, for the larger history of organizing against and resistance to the economically and racially ruinous consequences of the Jim Crow system. Itâs a kind of narrative thatâs aimed at retroactively manufacturing black consent for policies aimed at maintaining white supremacy.</p> <p>But in the absence of an organization like GLAAD, which is extremely familiar to both media companies and media reporters, condemning those remarks, most of the entertainment reportage focused on Robertsonâs anti-gay comments. Thatâs less a matter of disregard for racial bias, I think, than a focus instead on covering conflicts or potential conflicts between large organizations. And thereâs a particularly strong incentive to cover disputes that could evolve into disputes with economic consequences, like the advertiser boycott GLAAD was clearly threatening. The NAACP did co-author a letter to A&E; with the Human Rights Campaign. But that letter didnât mention advertisers, as GLAADâs statement did, and I wonder if it might have been interpreted more as a sign of consensus among gay organizations, than as proof of a broad-based coalition that objected to a range of Robertsonâs remarks. A&E; certainly reinforced that impression by focusing on the LGBT community in its statement announcing the suspension, explaining that âHis personal views in no way reflect those of A+E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.â</p> <p>Normally, the lifecycle of the Duck Dynasty scandal would end with the suspension. But in an attempt to score political points off the controversy, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has decided to express his great sorrow about a supposed suppression of Phil Robertsonâs right to free speech, which I was not aware included a guarantee to be paid to say whatever he pleased on a major television networkâs airtime.</p> <p>âI donât agree with quite a bit of stuff I read in magazine interviews or see on TV,â Jindal said in an official statement. âIn fact, come to think of it, I find a good bit of it offensive. But I also acknowledge that this is a free country and everyone is entitled to express their views. In fact, I remember when TV networks believed in the First Amendment.It is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended â</p> <p>These sorts of statements are always hilariously hypocritical coming from conservatives who in all other spheres of their lives want private enterprises like A&E; to be able to do whatever theyâd like. But it does suggest a particular frustration. Duck Dynasty does prove that thereâs a definitive market for Christian figures in reality television. But the backlash to Robertsonâs remarks does suggest that the market is limited to certain professions of Godliness, rather than to Phil Robertsonâs entire theological or political program. And the fact that A&E; is willing to respond to GLAAD and other organizations does demonstrate that it prioritizes some consumers over others, and that itâs more interested in being seen as compliant with some norms than others. Thatâs a fairly definitive valuation of Christian consumersâ worth to mass media. And I canât imagine that itâs a figure that makes Robertson, Jindal and plenty of other people particularly happy or comfortable.</p> <p>Itâs easy, I suppose, to dismiss the coverage of Robertsonâs remarks, his suspension, and Jindalâs follow-up as all-too-predictable. But in 2013, thatâs precisely why the cycle of the scandal matters. Weâve reached a point where the monetization of controversial figure as entertainment, their inevitable line-crossing, the organizations that exists to police that line-stepping, and the outrage that accompanies networksâ moderation of their own business strategies is an institution in and of itself. The relationships between all players in the cycle are symbiotic. But the power to influence culture and determine which political ideas are mass-marketable is decidedly real.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

6d6acfb9-b871-4fda-9014-a078a8b0304d,"On That Janesville Plant, Ryanâs Not Lyinâ",Ryan RNC Speech,"<p>The first skirmish after Paul Ryanâs sterling speech last night involved his example of the GM plant in Janesville, Wisconsin.</p> <p>Ed Morrissey, Avik Roy, Guy Benson, and Shikha Dalmia are among those examining the offerings of the self-appointed âfact checkersâ and finding them either mangling or botching the facts, or accusing Ryan of saying things he did not say.</p> <p>First, the excerpt:</p> <p>When he talked about change, many people liked the sound of it, especially in Janesville, where we were about to lose a major factory. A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said: âI believe that if our government is there to support you. this plant will be here for another hundred years.â Thatâs what he said in 2008. Well, as it turned out, that plant didnât last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And thatâs how it is in so many towns today, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>A lot of liberal bloggers are insisting that the plant was âshut downâ under the Bush administration. Thereâs the point when the orders for new vehicles stopped coming in, and the point when the plant actually completed its orders and stopped making them. One was in the closing months of the Bush administration, the other was in the opening months of the Obama administration: âThe Janesville plant stopped production of SUVs in 2008 and was idled in 2009 after it completed production of medium-duty trucks.â</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The plants are on âstandby,â and some would dispute whether that means the factory is âlost.â But the bottom line is that people arenât working there (other than whatever skeleton crew is sweeping the floors and maintaining the facility), they arenât collecting pay, and they are âlocked up and emptyâ: âSince they were shut down in 2009, both the Janesville and Tennessee plants have been on standby status, meaning they were not producing vehicles, but they were not completely shut down.â</p> <p>Some lefties are jumping up and down and saying, âBut Romney and Ryan opposed the GM bailout!â Yes, but thatâs not a fact at issue. Ryan doesnât claim that he and Romney would have, or even get into the bailout.</p> <p>That section is beautifully constructed because it brings the listener to many conclusions implied but not stated: That the bailout overpromised and underdelivered, that Obama makes promises he canât keep, and that the government is not to be relied upon to âsupport you.â The issue is less the GM bailout than the lack of genuine economic recovery. In the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel story quoted above:</p> <p>Auto industry observer David Cole, chairman emeritus of the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research, said it would be premature to say the Janesville plant will never reopen. âIf we get back to any kind of a reasonable market, with 15- or 16 million sales, then I think thatâs going to require Janesville as well,â he said. But the economy is recovering more slowly than people anticipated. âThatâs really the key factor,â Cole said. âYouâre going to see the company be exceedingly cautious on overcapacity. And they obviously didnât need a commitment for Janesville to get the UAWâs support.â</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The problem for the Janesville plant isnât the GM bailout. The problem is the national economy â the same problem that is preeminent in the minds of most voters this election.</p> <p>And thatâs the biggest problem for the Obama campaign with this entire debate and all of their arguments about precisely when the GM plant stopped making cars. Most voters will tune out the back-and-forth charges until the bottom line: âThe plant in Janesville is still closed.â</p>",Center,Right,Right,Right

Newt Gingrich, with his wife Callista, addresses the press following meeting at Trump Tower (Kevin Hagen/Getty Images)</p> <p>Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich railed against new White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci Thursday, calling him âfull of himselfâ and âpugnacious.â</p> <p>âI think Scaramucci is full of himself,â Gingrich declared in a radio interview with Laura Ingraham Thursday. âI think he got down here from New York, and he is all excited.

6f4d372b-a94e-45a9-bfe9-4ed4c2292db5,Trumpâs Strong Start on Policy,A first-year report card on Trump: strong start or worse than feared?,"<p>Gorsuch confirmed, ISIS defeated, taxes cut: The Trump administration has compiled a solid record of accomplishment in its first year, one that compares well with the records of many of its predecessors.</p> <p>Two of the biggest accomplishments came late in the year. The prime minister of Iraq declared victory over ISIS on December 9. Republicans reached a deal that seemed to secure passage of a tax bill on December 15. Until then, it appeared possible that 2017 would end without an all-Republican government enacting any major legislation.</p> <p>Now the Republicansâ policy record looks better, at least as most conservatives see it. The tax bill advances several longstanding conservative objectives. It cuts tax rates for most Americans, slashes the corporate-tax rate for the first time in decades, expands the tax credit for children, limits the reach of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, and scales back the tax break for expensive homes. By scaling back the deduction for state and local taxes, it may encourage a more conservative fiscal politics in the states. And it allows drilling to proceed in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p> <p>The tax bill also partly makes up for the failure of Republican efforts earlier in 2017 to repeal Obamacare. The health-care law imposes fines on people who go without insurance. The tax bill sets the fines at zero. The least popular feature of Obamacare is thus effectively nullified.</p> <p>Some conservatives would have considered voting for Trump in November 2016 worth it just for Justice Neil Gorsuch. His appointment to the Supreme Court means that Justice Scaliaâs seat will remain filled by an originalist for the next few decades. If one of the Democratic appointees or Justice Anthony Kennedy leaves the Court while Republicans hold the Senate, Trump will have the opportunity to create the first conservative majority in modern constitutional history. Trump has also nominated many well-qualified conservative jurists to the appeals courts. (The quality of his district-court nominees appears to be significantly lower.)</p> <p>x</p> <p>The administration has begun to rein in regulation. It has withdrawn and modified several of the Obama administrationâs regulations, often in concert with Congress. It has stopped or slowed the progress of many others that were barreling down the tracks. The Environmental Protection Agency, now run by Trump appointee Scott Pruitt, has also taken steps to end the practice of âsue and settle,â in which activist groups get the agency to adopt new policies through lawsuits.</p> <p>Trump killed President Obamaâs Clean Power Plan, which would have imposed significant economic costs while doing little to reduce the risks of global warming. He has effectively ended the Obama administrationâs mandate that employers provide contraceptive coverage: Employers who object to providing that coverage, or providing forms of that coverage they consider to cause abortions, are to be exempt. If the new policy stands, the Little Sisters of the Poor will be spending less time in court. Trumpâs education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has withdrawn Obama-era regulations that led colleges to lower the burden of proof for sexual-misconduct allegations and to monitor professorsâ speech.</p> <p>Conservatives of various types have thus seen progress on their agenda in 2017.</p> <p>Most conservatives cheered two symbolic actions by the administration: announcing that our embassy in Israel will move to the countryâs capital city of Jerusalem and that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. (I count that planned withdrawal as symbolic because the accord did not bind us to any policy commitments.)</p> <p>Conservatives of various types have thus seen progress on their agenda in 2017. Economic conservatives got tax cuts and some deregulation. Legal conservatives got judicial appointments and an executive branch more mindful of the limits of its policymaking authority. Social conservatives also benefited from the judicial appointments and welcomed Trumpâs policy of blocking international family-planning funding from going to organizations that promote or perform abortions.</p> <p>Many Republicans credit Trump for presiding over a strong economy, too. Itâs a point that requires some context. Job growth has not been quite as fast as it was in Obamaâs last year, but youâd expect it to slow after an expansion this long. Republican economic policies may have played a role in keeping the expansion going. Certainly the predictions of economic doom made right after the election by some Trump opponents â chiefly Paul Krugman â have not come to pass.</p> <p>Itâs not the only bad outcome that has been avoided. Trump has started no trade war and has not blown up the World Trade Organization. He has merely engaged in the low-grade protectionism that is routine for presidents of both parties, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership â which may not have been able to win congressional approval even if Trump had stayed in. NATO is still standing, too, and Trumpâs complaints about alliesâ burden-sharing may be arresting Western Europeâs slide into functional pacifism.</p> <p>How much Trump contributed to what has gone right in 2017 is debatable. He had less influence over the shape of the tax bill than most presidents exert over major laws. His unpopularity has probably dragged down the billâs poll numbers. The failure on Obamacare was partly his. And if we have avoided a trade war, it may because he has hired people who are undercutting him. He has reportedly complained that he wants to go further in imposing tariffs but his advisers keep thwarting him.</p> <p>People who voted for Trump in November 2016 on the theory that he would deliver policies radically different from what other Republicans would do should be disappointed. Those who voted for him because he would usually line up with conservatives and sign Republican bills, on the other hand, have reason to be pleased with his policy record.</p> <p>They may not like everything about this presidency, the effects of which will not be limited to changes in public policy. Many of Trumpâs conservative supporters share some of the concerns of the majority of Americans who oppose him. These conservatives wish the president had spoken more firmly and consistently to denounce the white supremacists in Charlottesville, or had kept his distance from Roy Moore, or had contained himself on Twitter. On policy matters, though, they are getting what they wanted from him.</p> <p>â Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor of National Review.

722c87c9-3448-4495-b04b-336303346fd3,Special counsel in Trump-Russia investigation partners with IRS,"Robert Mueller is now partnering with the Criminal Investigations Unit at the IRS to proceed with the Trump-Russia probe. The department specializes in financial crime, such as money laundering and tax evasion.","<p>We learned this week that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team investigating the Trump-Russia scandal have begun working with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D), whose office is also scrutinizing relevant players in the controversy. Itâs an important revelation: if charges are eventually filed against anyone involved in the affair, Donald Trump wouldnât be able to issue pardons to anyone accused of state crimes.</p> <p>But according to The Daily Beast, this isnât the only office Mueller and his team are working with.</p> <p>Special counsel Bob Mueller has teamed up with the IRS. According to sources familiar with his investigation into alleged Russian election interference, his probe has enlisted the help of agents from the IRSâ Criminal Investigations unit. This unit â known as CI â is one of the federal governmentâs most tight-knit, specialized, and secretive investigative entities. Its 2,500 agents focus exclusively on financial crime, including tax evasion and money laundering. A former colleague of Muellerâs said he always liked working with IRSâ special agents, especially when he was a U.S. Attorney. And it goes without saying that the IRS has access to Trumpâs tax returns â documents that the president has long resisted releasing to the public.</p> <p>NBC News has not verified The Daily Beastâs reporting, though as Joy noted on last nightâs show, the trajectory of the probe makes sense.</p> <p>The president, youâll recall, recently said he expects â and to a certain extent, demands â that Muellerâs investigation will steer clear of his finances. Thatâs never been an especially realistic expectation: if the probe leads to questions about whether the president has been compromised by a foreign adversary, it stands to reason the investigation will include a financial component.</p> <p>All of which gives Trump and his allies another reason to worry about the seriousness of this scandal.</p> <p>Paul Butler, an MSNBC legal analyst and a former federal prosecutor, added on the show last night, âThese are the big dogs of white collar prosecutions. They not only know how to follow the money, they know how to make a case and explain it to a jury in a way that makes it want to convict. So, I always say weâre a long way from charges being brought, but if thereâs a criminal case, if youâre a defendant, the last people you want going against you is C.I., the criminal investigations unit of the tax division.â</p> <p>* Postscript: The Daily Beastâs reporting added that if Mueller wanted to bring charges related to tax law at some point in the future, heâd need approval from the Justice Departmentâs elite Tax Division. That could be a little tricky: âTrump hasnât yet named his pick to run the division, which is a post that requires Senate confirmation.â</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left

National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate Doug Jones is in a death spiral, and this is their last ditch Hail Mary.</p> <p>You will notice both statements avoid addressing any specifics.</p> <p>The same goes for a fundraising appeal the judge sent out today. It did, however, raise the stakes on the allegations, attributing it not just to the lying fake-news media and the baby-killing socialists of the Democratic Party, but to Ole Lucifer and his hellish minions.</p> <p>The Obama-Clinton machineâs liberal media lapdogs have just launched the most vicious and nasty attacks against me Iâve EVER faced.</p> <p>I wonât get into the details of their filthy and sleazy attacks.</p> <p>I refuse to repeat their lies.</p> <p>The forces of evil are on the march in this country.</p> <p>We are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message.</p> <p>âSpiritual warfareâ is a conservative evangelical meme that enables Christian Right folk to equate earthly opponents with demonic supernatural forces. Itâs revealing that the judge and his campaign are Going There so quickly. It is very much a last resort.</p> <p>But an even more interesting religious defense of the judge was offered by Alabama state auditor Jim Ziegler, as reported by the Washington Examiner:</p> <p>âHeâs clean as a houndâs tooth,â Ziegler claimed, before relying on Scripture to defend Moore.</p> <p>âTake the Bible. Zachariah and Elizabeth for instance. Zachariah was extremely old to marry Elizabeth and they became the parents of John the Baptist,â Ziegler said choosing his words carefully before invoking Christ. âAlso take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.â</p> <p>Seems ânational liberal organizationsâ arenât the only ones trying a Hail Mary.</p> <p>When I was growing up as a Southern Baptist, the virgin birth of Jesus was one of the fundamentals taken as literal gospel truth. I donât know that Ziegler wants to go down the road of suggesting that the behavior Moore was accused of was conducted as part of the domestic life of the Holy Family. And there is the little problem that preying on underage girls runs afoul of the laws of Alabama even if Ziegler thinks the Bible condones it, though itâs true Moore has a habit of using the latter to defy the former.</p> <p>A more lawyerly excuse was offered by Breitbart Newsâ Joel Pollack, suggesting three of the four allegations arenât so bad:</p> <p>Breitbart's @joelpollak on MSNBC: ""The 16 year old and the 18 year old don't belong in that story."" â Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) November 9, 2017</p> <p>So I guess a prosecutor hitting on teenage girls â one of whom he first âapproachedâ when she was a 14-year-old Santaâs helper at the mall â should be taken out of the equation.</p> <p>The most honest response in defense of Moore was this one from a county GOP leader in Alabama:</p> <p>After a long pause, Alabama Bibb County Republican chairman Jerry Pow tells me he'd vote for Roy Moore even if Moore did commit a sex crime against a girl.</p> <p>""I would vote for Judge Moore because I wouldn't want to vote for Doug,"" he says. ""I'm not saying I support what he did."" â Daniel Dale (@ddale8) November 9, 2017</p> <p>Charles Pierce is probably not the only observer who thinks Moore will at some point throw himself on the mercy of the good Christian people of his state:</p> <p>[I]f Moore has the sand for it, he will follow this up with an explanation of how he had sinned, as all fallen humans do, but that Jesus has forgiven him and washed him in the blood of the Lamb, and now itâs time for him to bring his redeemed hindquarters to godless Washington to show the heathen the path to glory that heâs been blessed to follow. That might work.</p> <p>With each denial of culpability and each association of his accusers with Satan, Moore is making any later tearful confession of mere sinful human failing unlikely. And even if he manages to execute an about-face and to elicit expressions of forgiveness for his behavior, itâs doubtful Alabamans are going to want someone in the Senate who is as creepy as the Post story paints him as being when he was a grown-up prosecutor looking for love in exactly the wrong places.</p>",Left,Center,Left,Left

Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign has been punished by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for improperly accessing voter data compiled by Hillary Clinton's campaign.</p> <p>The Washington Post first reported late Thursday that Sanders' campaign manager had acknowledged a low-level staffer had viewed the information and was fired as a result. The Post reported that the DNC has told the Sanders campaign that it will not have access to the party's master list of likely Democratic voters until it provides an explanation and destroys any copies of Clinton campaign data that it posesses.</p> <p>The DNC rents out the master list to national and state campaigns, which add their own information compiled by volunteers and field workers.</p> <p>Being shut out of seeing the list for any length of time would be a major blow to Sanders, who is attempting to cut into Clinton's sizable lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p> <p>A Fox News poll released Sunday shows Clinton with a 14-point lead over Sanders among likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, while a poll of New Hampshire primary voters released Thursday shows the two in a statistical tie.</p> <p>The software vendor that handles the DNC master list told the Post that the breach occurred Wednesday while a patch was being applied to the software.

To further this objective, they produced a memo that reads like talking points for one of the anti-Trump tirades that take up much of the day and night on CNN or MSNBC.</p> <p>In fact, the Intelligence Committeeâs ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. â who few people had ever heard of before last year â has parlayed the endless Democratic conspiracy theories against President Trump into TV stardom. He gave 21 hours of TV interviews in 2017 to push his narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>The release of the Democratic memo was delayed because the Democrats deliberately included highly classified information that was difficult to declassify, so they could cry foul when the Trump administration refused to release this information. As a result, several sentences of the declassified memo were blacked out.</p> <p>The new Democratic memo â¦ was part of an ongoing round-the-clock campaign to weaken President Trump, delegitimize his election, and make him look like a Russian puppet who needs to be impeached.</p> <p>Typical for a Schiff media interview, the Democratic rebuttal starts off with wild accusations against Republicans for âa transparent effort to undermineâ the FBI, Justice Department, Special Counsel Robert Muellerâs Russia probe and congressional Russia investigations.</p> <p>Among the major points of the rebuttal, the Democrats claim:</p> <p>(1) The Justice Department followed proper procedures and had compelling national security reasons for seeking a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance of Carter Page.</p> <p>(2) The FISA Court was properly informed about the partisan sponsorship of the Steele dossier, a series of memos compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>(3) The Steele dossier did not drive the FBI investigation of Page or a FISA warrant application to spy on him.</p> <p>The Democratic rebuttal tries to justify the Justice Departmentâs October 2016 FISA warrant application to spy on Page with sensationalistic claims that he was on the FBIâs radar for years due to his alleged contacts with Russian spies.</p> <p>The rebuttal also makes claims about Pageâs interactions with Russians in mid-2016, when he reportedly was offered âdirtâ on Hillary Clinton. It claims a supposed Russian-linked source told Page that Russia had thousands of Clintonâs emails that it could leak to hurt her campaign.</p> <p>However, many of Pageâs alleged 2016 interactions with Russians have not been corroborated. Some come from the Steele dossier which, despite claims in the rebuttal, is still uncorroborated. Parts of the dossier have been shown to be untrue.</p> <p>The Democratic rebuttal also omits that Page had a brief, low-level role in the Trump campaign and was disparaged by a Russian intelligence officer in 2015 as âan idiot.â</p> <p>Like Schiffâs frequent TV news interviews, the rebuttal misrepresents or omits many inconvenient facts. Two of these make the entire rebuttal impossible to take seriously.</p> <p>First, the Republican memo said that Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified in a closed session in December 2017 that no warrant to spy on Page would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information. This is one of the most crucial points in the Republican memo, but the Democrats ignored it.</p> <p>Instead, the Democratic rebuttal dances around McCabeâs statement by stating that other information drove the FBI investigation. The Democratic memo says the Justice Department âprovided additional information obtained through multiple corroborated sources that corroborated Steeleâs reportingâ in the FISA warrant application.</p> <p>This is a major omission. Either McCabe did or did not say the Steele dossier was the crucial information that drove the FISA warrant request.</p> <p>The committeeâs Republicans should declassify the transcript of McCabeâs remarks to expose what is very likely a huge Democratic misrepresentation.</p> <p>Second, the Democratic rebuttal engages in verbal gymnastics to dispute Republican claims that the Justice Department failed to inform the FISA Court about the political sponsorship of the Steele dossier.</p> <p>The rebuttal tries to do this by citing a vague sentence from a footnote in the October 2016 FISA warrant request that said: âThe FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate 1âs [Donald Trumpâs] campaign.â</p> <p>The âidentified U.S. personâ was Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS, a company that was paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and in turn contracted with Steele to produce the dossier critical of Trump. This was not revealed to the FISA Court.</p> <p>This gobbledygook on the FBI âspeculatingâ that an unidentified U.S. person was seeking information to discredit the Trump campaign was designed to conceal from the FISA Court that the Steele memo was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. Incredibly, the Democratic rebuttal has no references whatsoever to the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>In fact, the footnote cited by the Democrats strengthens the Republican claim that the October FISA warrant request omitted crucial information on the veracity of the Steele dossier.</p> <p>The FISA judge obviously should have been told that a political party and a presidential campaign from one party funded a dossier to justify a FISA warrant to spy on a former member of a presidential campaign of the other political party. The Democratsâ claim that the Justice Department âaccuratelyâ informed the court about this matter is laughable.</p> <p>The highly misleading Democratic rebuttal is already having the intended effect by giving talking heads on TV news shows talking points to claim that the rebuttal disproved the Republican memo and provides evidence of collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.</p> <p>Expect Adam Schiff to be on TV as often as he can in coming days claiming his memo corrects the record. But the reality is that the Democratic rebuttal is full of the same unsubstantiated partisan claims that Schiff and other House Intelligence Committee Democrats have been making for over a year. It fails to rebut any of the serious allegations made by the committeeâs Republicans.</p> <p>The bottom line: donât believe Adam Schiff when he hawks this fake rebuttal. He didnât lay a glove on the Republican memo on serious abuses of the FISA process by the Justice Department, and the FBI to undermine the Trump presidential campaign.</p>",Right,Right,Right,Right

Note that the executive order only sets the minimum wage level for new contracts, as the White House cannot change the terms of existing contracts.</p> <p>Representatives Keith Ellison (D., Minn.) and Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.), co-chairmen of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, pushed for the change, and contended the raise would affect 2 million workers, which seems astonishingly high, considering that the high estimates of number of federal contractors is about 4.4 million.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>These comments from the Government Executive site indicate a federal contractor making minimum wage is rarer than henâs teeth:</p> <p>Can only speak from experience of contracting out logistics functions; never seen one contract where a single employee was paid âjust the minimum wageâ . . . I am Contracting Officer and havenât seen any contract that pays minimum wages. Most of the contractors make more than their counterparts in the private sector. Then you have administrative cost to manage the contract, so it already cost more to contract it out . . . If they raise the lower wage for non-skilled labor people, will that mean that OPM will have to adjust all the pay scales all the way up the line? I know that the WG [worker grade] scales are based on the local market but GS [general schedule] is only offset by local. Will4567 is right about contractors paying higher than minimum wage.

86a181e7-d173-4fca-be54-be2102d966a7,Obama To Raise Minimum Wage For Federal Contract Workers By Executive Order,Obama raises minimum wage for contractors,"<p>WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will announce during Tuesday nightâs State of the Union address that he's raising the minimum wage for workers under federal contracts to $10.10 per hour, an administration official told The Huffington Post.</p> <p>The new policy, to be instituted via executive order, may affect hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs are supported by federal dollars. The move is designed in part to ratchet up pressure on Congress to pass legislation raising the minimum wage for all workers. The current federal minimum wage stands at $7.25 per hour, and hasn't been raised since 2009, after the last of a series of increases signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.</p> <p>The new executive order is part of a broader pledge from the White House to pursue policies that donât rely on congressional approval. What other policies are in the works, the administration has refused to say.</p> <p>According to an Obama administration fact sheet, the executive order will cover âworkers who are performing services or constructing buildings and are getting paid less than $10.10 an hour.â Those likely to see bumps in future paychecks include dishwashers, food servers and construction workers. Many work in government buildings, but for private employers.</p> <p>The executive order to be announced by the president during Tuesday night's speech will take effect only for ânew contracts after the effective date of the order.â The administration will honor existing contracts, but the speech gives notice to contractors to adjust future bids -- likely by raising them -- to accommodate the higher wages.</p> <p>The move marks a significant victory for labor unions and a handful of progressive Democrats who pressed the president to issue the order, including Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).</p> <p>Ellison personally handed the president a letter on the matter last month. Just last week, at an event hosted by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, he publicly questioned Jason Furman, the chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, on whether Obama planned to issue the order. Ellison later criticized Furman for what he felt was an evasive answer.</p> <p>""We feel the federal government has a responsibility to set good labor conditions. We're not talking about anything outrageous,"" Ellison told HuffPost last week. ""If you look at the economics here, corporate profitability is very high now. They can afford it.""</p> <p>In recent months, the prospect of an executive order had become a rallying cry for low-wage workers employed in government buildings in Washington. The Change to Win labor federation, which includes the Service Employees International Union, has been organizing food-court workers at the Reagan Building, Union Station and even the Pentagon, carrying out a series of one-day strikes to draw attention to the low wages funded by federal dollars. The workers who took part made a point of noting that the president had the ability to raise their wages with the stroke of the pen.</p> <p>Mary Kay Henry, the president of SEIU, told HuffPost the order is one way for the president to directly boost the wage floor, with or without the help of Congress.</p> <p>""We call it a responsible contractor policy,"" Henry said. ""It sends a huge message to the private sector.""</p> <p>Last week, a group of low-wage service workers took part in a walkout at the Pentagon. One of the workers, Jerome Hardy, told HuffPost that after eight years working at the seat of the Defense Department he was still earning just $9 per hour. ""Not a penny raise -- a nickel, quarter, nothing,"" the 52-year-old said.</p> <p>The left-leaning think tank Demos produced a report last year showing that many of the food and janitorial jobs under federal contracts don't provide a living wage or basic benefits like health care or sick leave. Much of the taxpayer money instead ends up subsidizing the high salaries of executives at companies with concessions contracts, according to the report, titled ""Underwriting Bad Jobs.""</p> <p>During his State of the Union address, Obama also will call on Congress to enact legislation championed by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) to raise the overall federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour and peg it to inflation. That bill, which has broad Democratic support, would also increase the minimum wage for tipped workers, which hasn't budged in 20 years.</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left
86c6bb83-f7a3-4cf8-81d9-67068c5ea591,Donald Trump Is Now Leading the Polls in the Race to Be Worldâs Most Powerful Person,"The opening was unruly, with the firing of the DNC Chairman and unruly Sanders supporters. But the evening was all about unity.","<p>Photo: John Moore</p> <p>So, does a presidential candidate in a highly polarized environment get a ""bounce"" from a disorganized and divided convention that struck many of the nomineeâs enemies as reminiscent of certain 20th-century authoritarian spectacles? Apparently so. The first batch of post-convention polls universally shows Trump making gains. He now has a 0.2 percent lead in the RealClearPolitics polling average. But while some polls show a definite change in the two candidatesâ standing attributable to the convention, others suggest Trump was making gains going into Cleveland that simply continued (e.g., an L.A. Times/USC six-day poll showing Trump up 45-41).</p> <p>The source of Trumpâs gains varies by poll. A CNN/ORC survey gives Trump a 48-45 lead (44-39 with third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein included), a six-point improvement over the mogulâs performance in that outletâs last survey earlier this month. It shows the support for Trump spiking among independents and non-college-educated white voters (where he has a remarkable 62-23 lead). A CBS poll showing Trump up by one point indicates a slight consolidation of Republican and conservative votes for Trump, and a spike in HRCâs unfavorables. According to that survey, at least, all of the Clinton-bashing in Cleveland had an effect, though the pollster did not ask if respondents wanted to ""lock her up.""</p> <p>These findings will surprise some observers who thought this was one year when voters were so polarized that a convention âbounceâ was unlikely, and will clearly shock Democrats who watched the show in Cleveland and found it repellent. Given the unhappy convention-eve developments on the Democratic side (Politico is running one of those âconvention chaosâ stories from Philadelphia that echoes the Cleveland coverage), the natural assumption that Clinton will get a corresponding or even superior bounce is in question, though Democrats do have a significant advantage in rhetorical firepower.</p> <p>Whether they persist or not, Trumpâs post-convention gains are another sign that this is likely to be a close presidential race. That could be because of what the candidates are and are not doing, or simply because the country is so polarized that absolutely any nominees, however monstrous, are going to get in the neighborhood of 45 percent of the vote. Itâs also important to keep an eye on the âfundamentalsâ; the presidentâs job approval rating has sagged a bit in recent weeks. Thereâs no reason for any kind of Democratic panic at this point. But complacency about Trump being a self-destructive pushover is clearly no longer rational.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

As our Theodore Kupfer writes below, KABC radio host Leeann Tweeden says that Senator Al Franken groped and forcibly kissed her on a USO tour in 2006. While most people are likely to respond to the photo, the described behavior deserves its own focus:</p> <p>He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said âOKâ so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth. I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldnât be so nice about it the next time. I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth. I felt disgusted and violated.</p> <p>The statement from the senator is not really much of a denial: âI certainly donât remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasnât. I shouldnât have done it.â</p> <p>What is the appropriate response or consequence of this kind of gross behavior? Franken can hardly ask that it be dismissed as a youthful indiscretion; he was 55 at the time.</p> <p>Democrats are likely to be divided in their responses. Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri stated on Twitter, âIâm shocked and concerned. The behavior described is completely unacceptable. Comedy is no excuse for inappropriate conduct, and I believe there should be an ethics investigation.â</p>",Center,Right,Right,Right

The official also said it also ensured that taxpayers werenât paying for the upkeep of the server that was shared by Clinton, her husband, the former president, and their daughter as well as former aides, the Post reports.</p> <p>The State Department staffer in question, Bryan Pagliano, told a congressional committee that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights instead of testifying about the private server. A congressional source told Fox News on Friday that investigators on the Benghazi Select Committee hoped to question Pagliano, a former IT specialist, over possible destruction of evidence.</p> <p>Pagliano served as Clintonâs IT director of her 2008 campaign committee and then on her political action committee, according to The Post. He installed and managed her server and left his IT job at the State Department in February 2013, the same month Clinton stepped down as secretary.</p> <p>The Post reports the Clintons paid Pagliano $5,000 for âcomputer servicesâ prior to him joining the State Department, according to a 2009 financial disclosure form he filed. After he arrived on the State Departmentâs staff in 2009, he continued to be paid by the Clintons to maintain the server, a campaign official and another person familiar with the arrangement told The Post.</p> <p>When asked about whether the former IT specialist had been paid privately to maintain the server, a State Department official said the agency âfound no evidence that he ever informed the department that he had outside income,â The Post reports. This week, a different State Department official, couldnât clarify to the newspaper Paglianoâs pay situation.</p> <p>Pagliano reportedly didnât list any outside income in the required personal financial disclosures he filed each year. The Post reports he remains a State Department contractor doing work on âmobile and remote computing functions,â according to the State Department.</p> <p>Itâs not known exactly when or who âwipedâ Clintonâs personal email server. However, it seems clear the move came after October 2014, when the State Department requested personal emails be returned as part of her business records.</p> <p>Committee Republicans have long argued they donât have all the documents that should be available to the investigation, after Clinton, using her personal discretion, purged some 30,000 emails.</p> <p>Fox News put additional questions to Paglianoâs attorney, Mark J. MacDougall, Friday about whether his client played a direct role or had knowledge of the server scrub, but MacDougall said there was nothing further to add beyond the letter.</p> <p>An intelligence source who confirmed to Fox that the FBIâs âA-teamâ was handling the Clinton email case, described the investigation as âmoving along well,â adding investigators remain âconfidentâ deleted records can be recovered because whoever did the scrub may ânot be a very good IT guy.

891fe2ba-02fb-49a1-97c3-0f08a24cc2f4,Paul Ryan Bets on the Ignorance of America,Ryan RNC Speech,"<p>Photo: Win McNamee/2012 Getty Images</p> <p>Paul Ryan has a reputation as a nerdy budget wonk, but tonight in his RNC speech, he transformed into an attack dog. Running the gamut on the many, varied transgressions of President Obama â including the stimulus, the jobs crisis, ObamaCare, the debt, Medicare, and, obviously, âYou didnât built thatâ â Ryan had the crowd laughing, booing, and frequently showering him with piercingly loud standing ovations thanks to a slew of pitch-perfect applause lines. While this is just a hunch, we expect that his focus on Obamaâs inability to adequately revive the economy probably hit home with a lot of moderate voters. In short, it was, without a doubt, the best, most effective speech of the convention.</p> <p>It was also appallingly disingenuous and shamelessly hypocritical. To name but a few examples that the official and unofficial fact-checkers will be picking over tonight:</p> <p>Ryan claimed that the stimulus was a useless waste of money that did nothing for the American people and failed to address what should have been Obamaâs number one priority: creating jobs. But the stimulus did create jobs, millions of them. And Ryan requested some of those supposedly worthless stimulus funds for his district.</p> <p>Ryan said that Obama promised âin 2008â that the stimulus would save a GM plant in Janesville, Wisconsin, but âthat plant didnât last another year.â In reality, Obama made those remarks in February 2008 while running for president, the plantâs closing was announced in October 2008, and it closed in December 2008 â before Obama even took office, and months before the stimulus went into effect.</p> <p>Ryan thundered that Obama âcreated a bipartisan debt commissionâ which âcame back with an urgent report,â but Obama simply âthanked them, sent them on their way, and then did exactly nothing.â Ryan did not mention that he was on the debt commission, also known as Simpson-Bowles, and he voted against the plan it came up with.</p> <p>Ryan accused President Obama of plundering hundreds of millions of dollars from Medicare. The only part of Obamacare that Ryan kept in his budget plan? Those Medicare cuts.</p> <p>But hereâs the thing: Most of the millions of people who watched the speech on television tonight do not read fact-checks or obsessively consume news fifteen hours a day, and will never know how much Ryanâs case against Obama relied on lies and deception. Ryanâs pants are on fire, but all America saw was a barn-burner.</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left

Unlike most campaign stories, Trumpâs remarks grabbed the attention of nearly the entire American electorate. Then, on Sunday night, before an audience of 66.5 million, the GOP nominee claimed that he had never kissed or groped a woman without her permission.</p> <p>Days later, several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault against Trump. Many claimed that they were inspired to do so after seeing the Republican standard-bearerâs blanket denial at the second presidential debate.</p> <p>But is that claim really credible? Isnât it more likely that the Clinton campaign dispatched private investigators to every corner of the country to seek out women who had been groped by Donald Trump, and then â once they had identified a random handful of women who had been, or at least were willing to say that they were â instructed those women to keep their allegations quiet until the week of October 10, when two of them would go to the New York Times, while another would give her story to the Palm Beach Post, since that paperâs relative obscurity would make the idea that Clinton had planted the story seem preposterous? Doesnât that just make more sense?</p> <p>If you find that reasoning compelling, you might be Joe Scarborough.</p> <p>âIâm skeptical about the timing of all of this dropping. Talk about an October surprise,â the host of MSNBCâs Morning Joe said Thursday. âWhen, as you said, there have been a thousand triggering events. If I had been sexually harassed by this man, the Megyn Kelly story would have given me an opportunity â¦ Iâm just asking why, suddenly, all of this stuff is blowing up in October. Perhaps, itâs all innocent â¦ Iâm just saying skepticism is a good thing.â</p> <p>Msnbc's Morning Joe Scarborough says he's skeptical about latest Trump accusations. Why now? #NextFakeTrumpVictim https://t.co/rKY2SsSIZW â MicroSpookyLeaksâ¢ (@WDFx2EU7) October 13, 2016</p> <p>Scarboroughâs skepticism centers on the question âWhy are women only coming forward now, when Trump has been campaigning as a misogynist for over a year?â There are at least three simple answers to this question:</p> <p>1. The number of Americans closely following the presidential election is much higher now than it was when Trump was feuding with Megyn Kelly during the GOP primary.</p> <p>2. Women did come forward with accusations of sexual assault months ago. The New York Times ran a long story on Trump âcrossing the lineâ with women â including, allegedly, kissing and groping them without their permission â back in May. A former Miss USAâpageant contestant claimed that Trump had groped her in a Facebook post published in June. And the full trail of sexual-assault allegations against Trump goes back decades, to depositions from the mogulâs first divorce, in which Ivana Trump accused her ex-husband of rape.</p> <p>3. Last week, a video of Trump all but confessing to sexual assault surfaced and became both the biggest news story in the United States and the subject of one of the first questions at a presidential debate.</p> <p>On this last point, conservatives may have some cause for griping. While thereâs no reason to believe that Trumpâs latest accusers were saving their allegations for October, thereâs some evidence that NBC was saving its Access Hollywood footage for the right moment. Earlier this week, anonymous NBC executives told TMZ that the network had known about the tape for at least two months. According to TMZâs report, NBC had planned to release the video before the second debate, but decided to bump it so the story wouldnât compete with Hurricane Matthew for attention. This narrative is disputed by the network, but itâs plausible.</p> <p>Still, itâs worth noting that NBC is closely guarding the mother lode of Trump hot-mic videos â the outtakes from The Apprentice. The Clinton campaign is not pulling the Peacockâs strings.</p> <p>The fact that we are talking about Trumpâs sexual misconduct in October is not a product of some Clintonian conspiracy. Rather, itâs the product of the Clinton campaignâs competent messaging.</p> <p>Thereâs no question that the Democratic nominee wanted the media to put its spotlight on Trumpâs misogyny this month. Which is why she brought up the story of Alicia Machado at the first debate, and launched an ad starring the Miss Universe winner immediately afterward.</p> <p>And, even before the Access Hollywood video dropped, the Machado story had sparked multiple news cycles about Trumpâs long history of misogynistic comments and behavior. If America never became privy to Trumpâs backstage conversation with Billy Bush, then weâd be talking more about the âHoward Stern tapesâ â particularly, the clip in which Trump brags about his habit of deliberately walking in on beauty-pageant contestants while theyâre changing. Which, like Trumpâs boasts about sexual assault, were subsequently corroborated by multiple beauty queens, including contestants in Miss Teen USA, a pageant that included girls as young as 14.</p> <p>Over the past 48 hours, many conservatives have suggested that the liberal media suppressed news of Trumpâs raging misogyny throughout the GOP primary, and then unleashed all the worst bits right when it would do maximum damage to the Republican Party. This idea is absurd. One of the first questions at the very first GOP debate concerned Trumpâs history of demeaning comments toward women. Newspapers and magazines dug into past allegations of sexual abuse against Trump and aired them ahead of Super Tuesday.</p> <p>If only media reported during the primary on assault allegations against Trump he might not be nominee.</p> <p>Oh wait.https://t.co/fcFhS1DyIS pic.twitter.com/xQ7Gq6O7E8 â Nick MOWMEN (@NickBaumann) October 13, 2016</p> <p>GOP opposition researchers may not have had access to the Billy Bush tape. But no special access was required to dig through the archives of Howard Sternâs show. If Marco Rubio wanted to make Trumpâs mistreatment of women a central story line in the GOP primary, he could have introduced Alicia Machadoâs story at a Republican debate. Or his campaign could have leaked Trumpâs most retrograde Howard Stern comments to CNN. Or he could have highlighted the many accusations of sexual assault already reported and on the record. He chose not to do so.</p> <p>When Trumpâs misogyny was raised at that first debate, the mogul argued that any objection to his treatment of women was an example of political correctness run amok. There were nine other candidates on the stage that night. None saw a political advantage in challenging the mogulâs assertion. Conservatives should ask themselves why that is.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

If Handel had lost, it would have hardened the media narrative that Republicans are fleeing the president (note: I said narrative, not fiction. The man is at 72 percent among Republicans, but thatâs down eleven points in two months). A Handel loss would probably have led to actual politicians fleeing the president. Meanwhile, if Ossoff had won, Democrats would have been even more emboldened. They could go to donors and say, âWe bought a seat in a Republican district with a hipster doofus candidate, who got trolled into getting engaged. If we do it 23 more times, we get a Democratic House, a Speaker Pelosi, and maybe impeachment.â</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>In other words, in the realm of spin, appearances, and momentum, a Handel win is a huge victory for the White House.

This is a Republican district. The only reason it was close: A lot of Republicans voted for a Democrat. So, the GOP victory on the merits is pretty limited. Spending enough money to scald a wet mule (to borrow a phrase from Haley Barbour) to hold on to a district that Tom Price (Trumpâs HHS secretary) and Newt Gingrich held is not a sign of Republican health. Iâm okay with calling that a moral victory for Ossoff, as the media certainly will. But a moral victory plus $1.89* will buy me a large coffee at my local Starbucks. Meanwhile, a literal defeat for the GOP would have been a disaster.</p> <p>*Correction: Perhaps due to the Venti Irish whiskey the author consumed, he mis-characterized the cost of a large coffee from Starbucks.

8fe239d5-2f6a-42c1-9055-0db8b46ad837,"Obamacare, Job Loss, and Conservatives",Obamacare and Jobs,"<p>Iâm seeing a lot of liberal commentary along the following lines: Yes, Obamacare will reduce peopleâs willingness to work, but 1) thatâs because it loosens the link between employment and health insurance, and 2) thatâs something conservatives also want to do, and which their own preferred health policies would do. Sahil Kapur, for example, makes this argument.</p> <p>And conservatives should concede that thereâs a bit of truth to itâbut only a bit. But CBO isnât saying that Obamacare reduces peopleâs willingness to work solely or even mainly by letting them get health insurance without a job. CBO says that Obamacare reduces this incentive as well by raising peopleâs implicit marginal tax rate: the more money they make, the more Obamacare reduces their tax benefit. So 1) is not the full story. Obamacare shrinks the labor force more than just extending health coverage would.</p> <p>As for 2), the Coburn-Burr-Hatch bill also reduces tax benefits as incomes rise. But thatâs not a necessary feature of conservative health plans: The McCain and Ryan plans have not involved such phaseouts, for example.

He may or may not use his Twitter account to say the sort of words most Republicans are begging him to say about the racist provocateurs who strutted their lethal stuff in Charlottesville on Saturday, and who are planning an assortment of additional events next weekend to exploit the brouhaha over Googleâs diversity policies. This morning, Trumpâs only apparent expression of interest in the Charlottesville story was to blast the CEO of Merck for resigning from the presidentâs American Manufacturing Council to protest the White Houseâs moral myopia over the violence.</p> <p>But if Trump wanted to put this controversy behind him, and more generally, to address the long-term issue of his relationship with white supremacists, thereâs a model available to him. Back in 1965, when conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. was running for mayor of New York, he was asked during a candidateâs debate about racist supporters, and replied:</p> <p>In case such a person does exist, I want to say something to him: âLook, buster, I donât want your vote. You go off to the fever swamps and get yourself your own candidate, because Iâm not your man.â</p> <p>This statement didnât allay all concerns about Buckleyâs and American conservativesâ willingness to oppose civil-rights laws and support candidates (like Barry Goldwater) whom racists also avidly supported. And my colleague Eric Levitz is right in saying that words alone wonât atone for many years of GOP efforts to encourage and exploit white backlash to minority progress. For Trump, a flat disavow of white supremacists now will not erase the effects of a campaign that sought to capitalize on white resentment.</p> <p>But words matter, too. And Buckleyâs rebuke stands as a pretty good example of how politicians can stop being coy about despicable people in their ranks. Trump should emulate it if he ever gets around to addressing the nasty racists who adore him.</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left

However, he has decided to continue working at the White House while pressing Trump to take the events more seriously.","<p>President Donald Trumpâs administration parted ways with yet another staffer this week.</p> <p>Politico reported Thursday that Andy Hemming resigned from his position as the White House communications teamâs director of rapid response on Monday.</p> <p>The 31-year-old former Republican National Committee staffer, who was profiled by Politicoâs Annie Karni this month, was responsible for finding positive mainstream media news stories about the Trump administration and recirculating those reports to key reporters and talking heads. Hemmingâs goal was to ultimately create more mainstream coverage about positive moments for the Trump administration on the very networks the president routinely bashes and refers to as âfake news,â according to Karniâs piece.</p> <p>Every presidential administration has staffers dedicated to monitoring the press and pushing out stories related to favorable moments.

For instance, Vice News reported this month that the president receives a folder filled with positive news about himself twice a day â a report previous presidents apparently did not receive.</p> <p>Hemmingâs role in the administration was a bizarre one, considering his boss regularly picks public feuds with journalists and mainstream news outlets he was required to target with positive stories.</p> <p>Just this week, Trump spent a considerable amount of time trashing the media during his campaign rally in Phoenix a rant that resulted in the crowd chanting âCNN sucks.â</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left

Chris Christie (R-NJ) endorsed Donald Trump for president on Friday.</p> <p>âThere is no one who is better prepared to provide America with the strong leadership that it needs both at home and around the world, than Donald Trump,â Christie said at a news conference. âHe is, looking at the five people on that stage last night [at the GOP debate], the clear standout, and the person who will do exactly what needs to be done to make America a leader around the world again.â</p> <p>About five years ago, Christie made news for vehemently defending his decision to appoint a Muslim judge, Sohail Mohammed, to a state bench. Mohammed defended Muslims who were wrongly accused in the wake of the September 11 attacks, which some conservatives suggested made him an unqualified candidate.</p> <p>Christie made clear he was âdisgustedâ by the âignorance behind the criticism of Sohail Mohammed.â At an August 2011 news conference, he said:</p> <p>They are criticizing him because he is a Muslim Americanâ¦I was disgusted, candidly, by some of the questions he was asked by both parties at the Senate judiciary committeeâ¦Sharia Law has nothing to do with this at all â itâs crazy! Itâs crazy. The guyâs an American citizenâ¦This Sharia Law business is crap. Itâs just crazy, and Iâm tired of dealing with the crazies. Itâs just unnecessary to be accusing this guy of things just because of his religious background.</p> <p>Watch the video:</p> <p>Christieâs comments are inconsistent with Trumpâs much-publicized proposal to ban Muslims from the United States, a proposal heâs highlighted at campaign events that have featured violence and in at least one instance the ejection of a Muslim woman for no good reason.</p> <p>But both Trump and Christie have a history of moving from relatively moderate positions to positions further right on the political spectrum. For instance, Christie once supported an assault weapons ban, but now says he supports making it easier for people to own and carry guns. Trumpâs views on guns have evolved in a very similar direction.</p> <p>Both Christie and Trump went from being pro-choice to opposing abortion rights. Both were for Planned Parenthood before they were against it. (Trump acknowledges Planned Parenthood does âsome very good workâ but says as president he supports defunding the organization so long as they provide abortion services.)</p> <p>During his presidential campaign, Christie abandoned his support for a pathway to citizenship â a view that obviously aligns with Trumpâs harsh rhetoric about immigrants. Both he and Trump have said they arenât concerned about climate change.</p> <p>Last but perhaps not least, Christie and Trump both really, really dislike Marco Rubio.</p> <p>Christieâs endorsement of Trump comes about seven months after the governor downplayed the significance of Trumpâs campaign, telling Fox and Friends that ânobody in the real worldâ cared about Trumpâs immigration comments.</p> <p>In the same interview, however, Christie acknowledged he and Trump are longtime friends â a theme he returned to today.</p> <p>âHe has been a good and loyal friend to our family,â Christie, referring to Trump, said during todayâs newser.</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left

Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and is facing up to 5 years in prison.","<p>Thereâs not much middle ground here. In reading the single-count criminal information against Michael Flynn, I was struck by an immediate thought. If this is all there is, then Flynn is the victim of a monstrous injustice. If not, then brace yourselves. Weâre still only seeing the tip of the Mueller investigation iceberg. First, read the information here:</p> <p>Just in: Robert Mueller has charged former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn with âwillfully and knowinglyâ making âfalse, fictitious and fraudulent statementsâ to the FBI regarding conversations with Russiaâs ambassador. pic.twitter.com/WqvDmytYiZ â David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) December 1, 2017</p> <p>ABC also reports that Flynn is willing to testify against Trump and members of the Trump family. Now, before everyone starts yelling âcollusion,â the report said nothing about why Trump allegedly directed him to reach out to Russia. If it was contact for election collusion, thatâs dire. I also think thatâs highly unlikely. If it was contact to set the stage for post-election relations and cooperation, thatâs far less problematic â unless members of the Trump administration (or Trump family) have been lying to the FBI about those contacts. So, we could be looking at less of a criminal conspiracy and more of a festival of lies surrounding a non-conspiracy. Thatâs at least consistent with the guilty pleas (Flynn and Papadopoulos) so far. Stay tuned.</p>",Center,Right,Right,Right

Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., weighed in.</p> <p>âObamaCare is only making things worse,â Ryan said in a written statement. âThis costly law is not only pushing government spending to new heights, it is disrupting coverage and leaving millions of Americans worse off.â</p> <p>The budget office says jobs will also be lost because employers may choose to hire less full-time workers or reduce the hours of their staff.</p> <p>In 2010, the CBO projected ObamaCare would lead to about 650,000 fewer jobs. Tuesdayâs new 2.3 million estimate is significantly higher.</p> <p>The report states ObamaCare will also lead to a reduction of the net number of total hours worked by as much as 2 percent in the period from 2017 to 2024. It states that âlower-wage workersâ will see the biggest reduction in the number of hours worked.</p> <p>The agency also reduced its estimate of the number of uninsured people who will get coverage through the health care law.</p> <p>The budget experts now say about 2 million fewer people will get covered this year than had been expected, partly because of website problems that prevented people from signing up last fall when new markets for subsidized private insurance went live.</p> <p>Sen. Orrin Hatch, a ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, called the report âdevastatingâ to the millions of Americans seeking employment.</p> <p>âA direct threat to the long-term health and prosperity of our nation, this law must be repealed,â Hatch, R-Utah, said in a statement. âIts impact and consequences are too great.â</p> <p>House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said the report indicates ObamaCare is making things worse for Americans.</p> <p>âThis costly law is not only pushing government spending to new heights; it is disrupting coverage and leaving millions of Americans worse off,â Ryan, R-Wis., said.</p> <p>However, the White House focused on the report's claim that the loss of jobs will not be due to employers cutting back, but due to Americans choosing to voluntarily leave the workforce. White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement the report proves ObamaCare is allowing Americans to be ""empowered"" to make such a choice.</p> <p>""At the beginning of this year, we noted that as part of this new day in health care, Americans would no longer be trapped in a job just to provide coverage for their families, and would have the opportunity to pursue their dreams,"" he said. ""This CBO report bears that out, and the Republican plan to repeal the ACA would strip those hard-working Americans of that opportunity.""</p> <p>Carney also says the report does not take into account the estimate by experts that lower health care costs due to ObamaCare will lead to thousands of jobs being added to the economy annually.</p> <p>The report also predicted the U.S. budget deficit would fall to $514 billion this year, down substantially from last year and the lowest level by far since President Obama took office five years ago.</p>",Center,Right,Right,Right

This statement came after bipartisan criticism of the president's initial response to the violence in Charlottesville.","<p>Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images</p> <p>On Sunday, while the president was fielding advice about what, if anything, to say concerning lethal racist violence in Charlottesville, he was also facing another quandary: whether to pardon former Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff Joe Arpaio.</p> <p>âI am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio,â the president said Sunday, during a conversation with Fox News at his club in Bedminster, N.J. âHe has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. Heâs a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him.â</p> <p>Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt of court a couple of weeks ago for his serial defiance of a court order aimed at stopping his departmentâs eager use of racial-profiling methods. He was probably lucky he was only popped for a misdemeanor, since the racial profiling went on for years and Arpaio at one point admitted his lawyers had hired a private eye to investigate the wife of the judge he was battling. Then thereâs the fact that his fight with the courts cost his countyâs taxpayers well over $50 million. He could have been ordered to make restitution.</p> <p>Trump likely does sympathize with the old nativist demagogue â and not just because Arpaio was an early and avid backer of Trumpâs own campaign, and a big-league fellow birther. In October of last year, candidate Trump made it clearly known he didnât think racial profiling by cops was a problem:</p> <p>âThey [police officers] see somebody thatâs suspicious, they will profile,â Trump said. âLook whatâs going on: Do we really have a choice? Weâre trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse.â</p> <p>Perhaps thatâs why Trump thinks Arpaio âhas done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration.â</p> <p>Given his age (heâs 85), itâs unlikely that Arpaio will draw jail time when sentencing rolls around next month. But the president seems determined to make a gesture, saying he âmight [pardon Arpaio] right away, maybe early this week. I am seriously thinking about it.â</p> <p>Maybe heâll issue the pardon to make sure his alt-right supporters donât misunderstand todayâs condemnation of racism as applying to good patriotic Americans like Arpaio. Whatâs racist about a little racial profiling? Latinos being pulled over for what they look like have nothing to worry about so long as they havenât broken any laws, right?</p> <p>No, the presidentâs much-delayed and apparently grudging denunciation of racism today is not going to allay doubts about his ability to look at nonwhite Americans and see fellow âpatriots.â</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

During an âunrelated investigationâ* it uncovered e-mails that âappear to be pertinentâ to Clintonâs case. It is seeking to determine whether the e-mails contain classified information and canât yet determine their significance.</p> <p>Stripped of the legalese, it means that Hillary is back in legal jeopardy. The FBI doesnât investigate and recommend enforcement actions against computer servers. It holds people accountable, and Hillary is the person most responsible for her own e-mail. I have three initial thoughts.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>First, these e-mails must be prima facie problematic. There is no way the FBI publicly re-opens this investigation on the eve of a presidential election if the new e-mails contained information about yoga routines or wedding plans. Moreover, the very fact that the FBI is trying to determine whether the e-mails contain classified information indicates that their content is setting off alarm bells in the Bureau. In other words, this is serious.</p> <p>Second, the e-mails could have an impact on the decision whether to charge Hillary or her aides either under the Espionage Act or for obstructing the initial investigation, perhaps by lying to the FBI. Recall that Comey previously exonerated Clinton under a made-up legal standard, but if there are more e-mails â and if Clinton or her aides worked to conceal their existence from the FBI â then their conduct may even rise to the FBIâs arbitrary, higher threshold of lawlessness. At the very least, it renders the FBIâs previous decision not to prosecute even more suspect.</p> <p>#related#Third, unless the FBI announces the investigation and clears her within the span of basically one work week (an action that would be deeply problematic on its own terms), Hillaryâs closing argument to the American people is going to be that Donald Trump is so dangerous that itâs worth gambling your vote on a woman under current criminal investigation.</p> <p>Will there be any Democrats who will urge Clinton to step aside? Exactly three weeks ago, the Washington Post released tapes showing Donald Trump bragging about committing actions that easily meet the legal test for sexual battery. In the aftermath, a number of Republicans asked him to step aside for the good of the country. Now itâs the Democratsâ turn. Their candidate is back under criminal investigation. Millions of people have already cast votes for her believing sheâd been âcleared.â Is her personal ambition worth this national pain?</p> <p>*Update: It turns out the âunrelated investigationâ that triggered the FBIâs decision was its investigation into Anthony Weinerâs serial sexting.</p>",Right,Right,Right,Right

Thank you â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017</p> <p>The move, which ironically comes in the middle of the White Houseâs American Heroes Week, was wholly unexpected. Itâs not clear why Trump decided to announce such a significant policy change via Twitter or when it would take effect. His timing in relation to other political events is also odd: He shared the news in the midst of Senate Republicansâ high-stakes fight to repeal Obamacare this week.</p> <p>Trump claims he made the move after consulting with military experts, despite the Pentagon lifting the ban on transgender service members in 2016 after an exhaustive review of its military readiness policies.</p> <p>âOur mission is to defend this country, and we donât want barriers unrelated to a personâs qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman or Marine who can best accomplish the mission,â then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said. âWe have to have access to 100% of Americaâs population for our all-volunteer force to be able to recruit from among them the most highly qualified â and to retain them.â</p> <p>The biggest question is what the news means for the thousands of transgender men and women currently serving in the military. There are between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender people in active military service, a Rand Corp. study estimates. Another group, the Palm Center, put the number as high as 15,500 a few years ago.</p> <p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders couldnât give any details later Wednesday when she was asked what will happen to the transgender troops currently serving overseas or when the ban will take effect. During her daily press briefing, she repeatedly said the White House and the Defense Department will work out those specifics.</p> <p>Asked about Trumpâs pledge as a candidate to fight for the LGBTQ community, Sanders said his decision to ban transgender troops was about âmilitary readinessâ and that the president âhas been very clear heâs committed to fighting for all Americans.â As more questions poured in, Sanders said she would end the briefing if reporters didnât ask about other topics.</p> <p>âIf those are the only questions we have, weâre going to call it a day,â she said.</p> <p>The Pentagon has been referring all questions about the change to the White House.</p> <p>NEW: Pentagon statement on Pres Trump's transgender servicemember tweets -refers all Qs to the White House</p> <p>(h/t @ABC's @Elizabeth_McLau) pic.twitter.com/avibiD4Te3 â Karen Travers (@karentravers) July 26, 2017</p> <p>One thing that is clear is that conservatives have been gunning for this change. The right-wing Family Research Council was among the first out with a statement praising Trump for taking the step.</p> <p>âI applaud President Trump for keeping his promise to return to military priorities â and not continue the social experimentation of the Obama era that has crippled our nationâs military,â said the groupâs president, Tony Perkins. âThe military can now focus its efforts on preparing to fight and win wars rather than being used to advance the Obama social agenda.â</p> <p>Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), who unsuccessfully tried to deny hormone therapy and gender transition-related care to transgender troops during debate on a defense spending bill this month, also hailed Trump for being concerned about the cost of providing care to transgender service members.</p> <p>Pleased to hear that @realDonaldTrump shares my readiness and cost concerns, & will be changing this costly and damaging policy #readiness â Rep. Vicky Hartzler (@RepHartzler) July 26, 2017</p> <p>But those costs are incredibly low: Rand Corp. estimates 30 to 140 people would seek new hormone treatments per year, and 25 to 130 would seek gender transition-related surgeries. That amounts to a 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in the Defense Departmentâs total health care spending, per Rand.</p> <p>The American Medical Association has emphasized the medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and gender-transition surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for people diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a âserious medical conditionâ that stems from the distress a person feels when his or her gender identity does not correspond with his or her birth sex. Not all transgender people are diagnosed with gender dysphoria; some donât experience that distress.</p> <p>LGBTQ rights groups slammed Trump for making the change solely to appease his conservative base.</p> <p>âThis has been studied extensively, and the consensus is clear: There are no cost or military readiness drawbacks associated with allowing trans people to fight for their country,â said Joshua Block, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Unionâs LGBT & HIV Project. âThe president is trying to score cheap political points on the backs of military personnel who have put their lives on the line for their country.â</p> <p>Gregory Angelo, the president of Log Cabin Republicans, a group that represents LGBTQ conservatives, said Trumpâs move âsmacks of politics, pure and simple.â</p> <p>âThe United States military already includes transgender individuals who protect our freedom day in and day out,â Angelo said. âExcommunicating transgender soldiers only weakens our readiness; it doesnât strengthen it.â</p> <p>The presidentâs action completely contradicts his 2016 campaign claims about being better for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans than his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Trump dodged the draft a total of five times, once arguing he couldnât serve in the U.S. military because of bone spurs in his heels.</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left

The birther issue has forced him into an untenable situation where he has had no choice. Trump used unhinged claims about President Obamaâs citizenship to win the favor of Republican voters, but the taint has contributed to his justified image as a racist. The Washington Post asked Trump about it again Thursday night. In a hasty effort to put the issue behind him, Trump held what was billed as a press conference but turned out to be a series of canned testimonials by supporters, followed by a perfunctory statement disavowing birtherism and shifting the blame to his opponent.</p> <p>Trumpâs event had an array of distinctly Trumpian touches. He held it at a Trump hotel and boasted about its luxuriousness and efficient construction. He surrounded himself with Medal of Honor winners, using their courage as a cover for his own retreat. (Trump pulled the same trick when he skipped the Republican debate in Iowa, holding a veteransâ event so that the theme of bravery would mask the cowardly act of backing out of a public contest with his rivals.) He told brazen lies. And the particular character of the lies flipped the racial onus. âHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,â he said. âI finished it.â</p> <p>Neither of these claims is remotely defensible. Fact-checkers have examined the rumor that Clinton, or her campaign, began spreading questions about Obamaâs citizenship, and they debunked it. The second claim, that Trump put the birther issue to rest by forcing Obama to produce his birth certificate, is likewise false, as Trump continued to question Obamaâs citizenship for years afterward.</p> <p>But the absurd line fits with Trumpâs overarching defense on questions of racism. His tactic is to charge that his opponents are the racists and he is the innocent victim. Democrats are âthe party of slavery,â he has said. It is a popular line among conservatives. It is, of course, correct that the Democrats used to contain, and before that were dominated by, a conservative white southern wing with reactionary views on race. Over time, that wing migrated out of the party as Democrats embraced civil rights, but the history allows modern racial reactionaries to disavow any historical connection to their antecedents.</p> <p>Trump is compressing this historical cycle into a much shorter span. First, he uses birtherism to gain a massive fanbase that he leverages into the Republican nomination. Next, he foists the blame for this issue onto his opponent. By this point, most of his fans are prepared to believe literally anything he says. Why not call Hillary Clinton the real birther?</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

Conversely, many on the Right are saying that the event should not be politicized until all information has been acquired and the dust has settled.","<p>Comedian Megan Amram responded to a TMZ story that Las Vegas massacre gunman Stephen Paddock doesnât fit the typical mass shooter profile by tweeting, âWhite man? Sure does.â</p> <p>TMZ published an article making a case that Paddock is unique for a mass shooter, as he is older (64), lived in a retirement community and didnât have a known criminal record.

On Wednesday evening, The New York Times reported on two women who said they were groped by the real estate mogul â one during a plane ride more than three decades ago, the other outside an elevator 11 years ago. Another woman told the Palm Beach Post that Trump grabbed her inappropriately 13 years ago. People magazine published a first-person account from writer Natasha Stoynoff detailing how Trump forced himself on her during an interview at his Mar-a-Lago estate.</p> <p>Trump denied those allegations at a rally on Thursday, accusing the press of trying to undermine his candidacy. âThese events never, ever happened,â he said.</p> <p>His spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told HuffPost that Boyneâs story was a fabrication. âMr. Trump never heard of this woman and would never do that,â Hicks said.</p> <p>Another woman who was at the dinner said she couldnât recall Trump acting in that fashion. However, she did confirm that the dinner took place, acknowledged that Boyne was there and suggested that women were climbing atop tables that evening.</p> <p>Boyneâs allegations also echo the accounts of other Trump accusers, who have come forward since he was caught on a hot mic bragging about grabbing and kissing women without their consent.</p> <p>The incident she describes took place in the summer of 1996. At the time, Boyne was a 25-year-old think tank employee living in Manhattan who had become good friends with Sonja Morgan, then Sonja Tremont, and now a cast member on Bravoâs âReal Housewives of New York.â</p> <p>Lisa Boyne Lisa Boyne (left) pictured with Sonja Morgan, now a ""Real Housewives of New York"" cast member.</p> <p>One night that summer, Boyne said that Morgan, who was well-connected in New Yorkâs elite social circles, invited her to dinner in Lower Manhattan with Trump and John Casablancas, the famed modeling agent who died in 2013. Trump and Morgan picked Boyne up at her apartment.</p> <p>According to Boyne, Trump dominated the conversation in the limo, boasting of his sexual conquests and rating their attractiveness.</p> <p>âHe was constantly talking about himself, who he was dating, who he was sleeping with, who he was trying to sleep with,â Boyne said. âI just remember feeling very surprised and upset.â</p> <p>Once at the restaurant, the group met up with Casablancas, who had brought along five or six models. It quickly became clear to Boyne that this was an opportunity for Trump to meet young, attractive women. Months earlier, Trumpâs then-wife Marla Maples had allegedly been caught sleeping with a bodyguard. (Trump and Maples would officially divorce in 1997.)</p> <p>According to Boyne, the group was seated at a semi-circular table, with the women in the middle and Trump and Casablancas flanking either end. The women couldnât get out of their seats without one of the men getting up â which they refused to do. Instead, Boyne said, Trump insisted that the women walk across the table, allowing him to peer up their skirts while they did so. Trump âstuck his head right underneath their skirts,â Boyne said, and commented on whether they were wearing underwear and what their genitalia looked like.</p> <p>Boyne said that Trump never made any such advance on her. âIâm not a model. He wasnât interested in me,â she said. âHe was more interested in my opinion of who I think he should sleep with. I remember that vividly.â</p> <p>Eventually, however, she insisted that the men let her leave her seat. She found a payphone at the restaurant to call her roommate. At her roommateâs suggestion, Boyne returned to the table, told the group she wasnât feeling well and went home.</p> <p>Lisa Boyne Lisa Boyne (left) pictured with Sonja Morgan on a separate occasion.</p> <p>In an interview on Thursday, Morgan confirmed that the dinner took place and even named the restaurantâ Raoulâs in the SoHo neighborhood of New York. She also confirmed that Trump, Casablancas and several models were in attendance, but she denied any lewd actions on Trumpâs part.</p> <p>âI donât remember any of that kind of behavior,â Morgan said. âBut I have been known to dance on tables.â</p> <p>The roommate Boyne called, Karen Beatrice, said she never heard from Boyne that night, although she did not deny that a dinner took place. Beatrice, who described Boyne as a publicity seeker, added that she once worked as a model and had met Trump as well.</p> <p>âHe was nothing but gracious and charming,â Beatrice recalled.</p> <p>Boyne said she was shocked by Beatriceâs refusal to confirm the incident and said Beatrice was one of the few people she had talked to about the incident over the years. She doesnât recall ever talking to Morgan about that night.</p> <p>As for why she is coming forward now, Boyne said she experienced a âflashbackâ to that 1996 dinner when she saw a New York Times story in May detailing a number of disturbing stories of how Trump has interacted with women in private. When the 2005 recording of Trump boasting about sexual assault emerged last week, she felt compelled to share her story.</p> <p>âI met lots of famous, influential wealthy people with Sonja, and none of them were ever as vulgar, as disgusting, as rude, as sexist, such a low excuse for a human being that Iâve ever met. I was so deeply offended, I felt that like with Bill Cosby, the more people that come forward, the more legitimacy the story will have,â Boyne said.</p> <p>âI find it hard to believe that heâs changed,â she added. âThat was who he was. He was somebody who was interested in women as sex objects and their only merit was their beauty.â</p> <p>Editorâs note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims â 1.6 billion members of an entire religion â from entering the U.S.</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left

By all accounts grounded on this round and real Earth, he was also exceedingly dishonest. Whether or not voters will care comes later, but in this age of outwardly partisan media and the political fact-check, in which the slow death of faux-objectivity continues to creep in, it can be telling to watch the tightrope act of news outlets determined to stay fair and balanced while dealing with the distortions pouring from our leadersâ mouths. Americans may not all be sorting through the wonky particulars, but one word everyone understands is âlie.â And yet some in the media still opt for euphemisms.</p> <p>The front page of the New York Times today reads right up top, âRyan calls for a U.S. Turnaround, Led by Romney.â The accompanying article first addresses the plentiful contractions and outright lies in Ryanâs speech in the second paragraph, but only by noting that he said âhe would stand with Mitt Romney in embarking on a generational struggle to protect the very social program â Medicare â that Democrats accuse him of trying to dismantle.â They said it, not us! The story then goes on to quote Ryan for more than ten paragraphs before calling him on another hypocritical attack, again by assuming âDemocrats will be certainâ to take issue with it. While a few other holes in Ryanâs speech are mentioned, his honesty is never questioned outright; the word âlieâ does not appear.</p> <p>Itâs also not in a subsequent fact-check article about the speech, though âlieâ comes up twice in the first paragraph of a post on the Opinion blog under the headline, âBeyond Factual Dishonesty.â Presumably it doesnât quite have the same impact there. When Times public editor Arthur Brisbane asked, âShould the Times be a truth vigilante?â the answer was apparently yes, just not right away.</p> <p>The fact-checks are everywhere today: Salon calls out Ryan for his âBSâ and âbrazen lies,â while the Washington Post lists âthe misleading and the downright false.â The Huffington Post has a blog entry called âPaul Ryan: Lying Liar,â but even the proudly left-leaning site goes with the clunkier âDemonstrably Misleading Assertionsâ in its lead column on the speech.</p> <p>Thereâs also USA Today, NPR, AP, and CNN, none of which use the L-word. On air, the line-straddling Wolf Blitzer called Ryanâs remarks âa powerful speechâ with âseven or eight points Iâm sure the fact checkers will have some opportunities to dispute if they want to go forward.â</p> <p>Individuals, on the other hand, relegated to personal blogs and opinion sections, took more liberties, like Jonathan Bernstein at the Washington Post, who called out Ryanâs âstaggering, staggering lieâ about Obamaâs debt commission. But Ryanâs falsehoods, when dissected, are not opinion, they are fact. The truth, even! Most surprisingly, in a move giddily pointed out everywhere, Sally Kohn wrote on FoxNews.com, âRyanâs speech was an apparent attempt to set the world record for the greatest number of blatant lies and misrepresentations slipped into a single political speech.â</p> <p>Perhaps the sheer number of outlets covering the Ryan speech with some skepticism, rhetorical gymnastics aside, will seep into the public consciousness beyond obsessive blog-readers and Twitter addicts. Headlines do have a way of working via osmosis at a certain saturation point. But for news organizations to pull punches in the places most people get their news â like the front page of the newspaper or primetime cable insta-analysis â and then even again later with delicate wording, indicates that âhe said, she saidâ journalism lives on at the forefront. Facts are on the fringes, pounding on the gate, but might get through more effectively not solely by strength in numbers, but with a sharper tongue.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

If war broke out with Russia tomorrow, would we be better off because our female soldiers, Marines and sailors were having to mentally prepare to shower with âwomenâ who had male genitals? I think the answer is an obvious no.</p> <p>Call me stupid, but I trust the opinion of Secretary of Defense Mattis more than I trust the opinion of a hack on Twitter who is complaining about this decision.</p> <p>Iâm also not going to weigh in on whether or not being transgender is a mental illness. There are already plenty of people discussing that.</p> <p>All I have to say is that I couldnât be happier with this choice. The military exists to defend this country, help our allies and kill any sorry son of a gun that desperately wants to head over to the afterlife. It doesnât exist to push social narratives or test out experiments.</p> <p>Follow David on Twitter</p>",Right,Center,Right,Right
b4792829-fefb-40a9-b136-63e19bbed7f2,Conservatives Seize On Report To Argue Obamacare Is A Job Killer â But The Author Says Theyâre Wrong,Obamacare and Jobs,"<p>On Wednesday, Congressional Budget Office (CBO) director Doug Elmendorf refuted the claim that the Affordable Care Act is a job killer â a misleading takeaway from his agencyâs new report that is being touted by Obamacare critics.</p> <p>Testifying before the House Budget Committee on the CBOâs newly released economic projections for the next decade, Elmendorf addressed the reportâs finding that the Affordable Care Act will reduce the labor participation rate and the total number of hours worked by an equivalent of 2 million jobs in 2017. According to Elmendorf, that statistic is being taken out of context to suggest that Obamacare will eliminate jobs.</p> <p>âThe reason we donât use the term âlost jobsâ is there is a critical difference between people who like to work and canât find a job â or have a job thatâs lost for reasons beyond their control â and people who choose not to work,â he explained. âIf someone comes up to you and says, âThe boss says Iâm being laid off because we donât have enough business to pay,â any other person feels bad about that and we sympathize for them having lost their job. If someone says, âI decided to retire or stay home and spend more time with my family and spend more time doing my hobby,â they donât feel bad about it â they feel good about it. And we donât sympathize. We say congratulations.â</p> <p>Even Budget Committee Chairman and former GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan conceded that point in part. âJust to understand, it is not that employers are laying people off,â said Ryan at the beginning of the hearing.</p> <p>In fact, the CBO report explicitly states that the estimated reduction in labor âstems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businessesâ demand for laborâ and that âthere is no compelling evidence that part-time employment has increased as a result of ACA.â Those notions are further supported by economic data on full- and part-time employment trends over the last several years. Simply put, the report finds that Obamacare will reduce the number of people who are forced to work a job merely for the sake of health insurance.</p> <p>Elmendorf also noted that the ACA is actually expected to boost the economy in the near-term by making health insurance and medical care affordable for the poorest Americans, giving them the freedom to spend money in other areas of the economy. âOn balance, CBO estimates that the ACA will boost overall demand for goods and services over the next few years,â states the report.</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left
b797ece5-54cb-4d34-9bac-9a42f0c37d6f,Michael Flynn's Offense Statement & Collusion -- No Evidence,"Michael Flynn will reportedly testify against President Trump, saying that the then-candidate ordered him to make contact with the Russians during the election. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and is facing up to 5 years in prison.","<p>Moments ago, the special counsel released Michael Flynnâs âStatement of the Offense.â This document lays out Flynnâs crimes in far greater detail than the short âinformationâ released earlier today. Itâs important to state this clearly as possible â the statement contains no evidence of collusion with Russia to influence the presidential election. Instead, it amplifies the fact that Flynn apparently lied about contacts that were lawful and appropriate.</p> <p>First, the statement says that the day after President Obama announced sanctions in response to Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 election, Flynn called a âsenior official of the Presidential Transition Team (PTT)â who was with other âsenior members of the PTTâ at Mar-a-Lago. On the call, Flynn and the âsenior officialâ said that they did not want Russia to âescalate the situation.â Flynn called the Russian ambassador âimmediately afterâ his call with the senior official to communicate the incoming administrationâs request. The next day, Putin announced that Russia would not retaliate against the United States, and the Russian ambassador later informed Flynn that Putin had decided not to retaliate in response to his request.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Second, the statement also says that Flynn initiated contact with Russia and other foreign governments in an effort to influence a U.N. Security Council vote on an Egyptian resolution condemning Israeli settlements. Flynn made these calls at the behest of a âvery senior memberâ of the PTT. In this instance, Flynn was unsuccessful. The Russian ambassador told Flynn that âRussia would not vote against the resolution.â</p> <p>Third, the statement briefly outlines false statements Flynn made about his relationship with the government of Turkey. These false statements appear unrelated to any dealings with Russia, in any capacity.</p> <p>While Twitter will no doubt find it âshockingâ and âoutrageousâ that Trump transition officials were trying to influence Russian policy on matters that would directly impact the Trump presidency, there is a long history of presidential campaigns and transition teams initiating contact with foreign powers. The Trump administration â not the Obama administration â would bear the primary burden of responding to any additional Russian sanctions and the fallout from the U.N. vote. In other words, we can debate the prudence of the PTTâs actions all day long, but it was not illegal, and it was not âcollusion.â</p> <p>At the same time, however, itâs becoming increasingly clear that Trump officials hid their (lawful) Russian contacts behind a smokescreen of lies. The next targets for Mueller may well be the âsenior officialâ and the âvery senior memberâ of the PTT. The Internet will light up with speculation about their identities â and leaks may well out them before Muellerâs ready to make his next public move â but itâs pretty clear (at least at this point) that the collusion narrative has taken a series of body blows.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>One last point â a number of folks have asked me, âIf thereâs no collusion, why lie about these contacts?â I can think of a number of reasons, including inexperience, hubris, and paranoia. Remember, these contacts were taking place against the backdrop of a public feeding frenzy about Trumpâs Russian contacts. To admit to these contacts was to churn waters already boiling with hungry sharks. So they chose the worst possible course. They lied, and they lied when active FISA warrants meant that investigators may have immediately spotted the lies. When you start the lies, itâs hard to stop â especially when you donât know what the FBI knows, but you do know that changes in your story will almost certainly leak to the press and create yet another firestorm.</p> <p>So, at the end of the day, we may well end up with multiple senior members of the administration facing prison time for covering up no crime and no collusion, just contacts. If thatâs justice, itâs a form of justice that will leave no one standing on the political high ground and partisans on both sides seething with rage and bitterness.</p> <p>Update: Like clockwork, it looks like the âvery senior memberâ of the PTT who asked Flynn to contact Russia about its U.N. Security Council vote has been unmasked. Bloombergâs Eli Lake reports that itâs Jared Kushner:</p> <p>At the time, the U.N. Security Council resolution on Israeli settlements was a big deal. Even though the Obama administration had less than a month left in office, the president instructed his ambassador to the United Nations to abstain from a resolution, breaking a precedent that went back to 1980 when it came to one-sided anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N. This was the context of Kushnerâs instruction to Flynn last December. One transition official at the time said Kushner called Flynn to tell him he needed to get every foreign minister or ambassador from a country on the U.N. Security Council to delay or vote against the resolution. Much of this appeared to be coordinated also with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose envoys shared their own intelligence about the Obama administrationâs lobbying efforts to get member stats to support the resolution with the Trump transition team.</p> <p>Unless Kushner has lied to the FBI about these contacts, this is not a scandal. Nothing that weâve seen in any of the plea deals or indictments yet indicates any scheme to collude with Russia to influence the election. To be sure, we havenât seen all the evidence (ABC reports that Flynn was instructed to contact Russia during the campaign, and we donât yet know the substance of these contacts), but right now it looks like Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI about doing his job.</p>",Center,Right,Right,Right
b8e266a9-1c3b-483a-8ee8-a490da31195b,Hillary Clinton slammed for âignorantâ statement on guns after Las Vegas shooting,"Many politicians, members of the media, and other public figures are offering condolences as well as opinions in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 58 dead and 500 others injured in Las Vegas Sunday night. Many people on the Left are calling for stricter gun legislation and for Congress to act quickly in response to the shooting. Conversely, many on the Right are saying that the event should not be politicized until all information has been acquired and the dust has settled.","<p>Hillary Clinton took heat Monday for issuing what critics called an âignorantâ and âirrelevantâ statement going after the NRA and silencers in the hours after the Las Vegas mass shooting.</p> <p>As details were still emerging about the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history â which killed at least 58 people â the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee took to Twitter to imagine how much deadlier the massacre might have been if silencers had been used.</p> <p>âThe crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get,â she tweeted, adding: âOur grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.â</p> <p>It was an apparent reference to the NRAâs push to ease federal rules for silencers.</p> <p>But conservative critics quickly hit back, saying silencers probably would only moderately dampen the sound of gunfire in this kind of attack â especially from what was described as a high-powered weapon.</p> <p>âSuppressors only reduce by a few decibels, still same decibel level as a jackhammer,â tweeted Dana Loesch, a talk radio host and NRA spokeswoman.</p> <p>Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, editor in chief of The Daily Wire, blasted Clintonâs tweets as âIgnorant, irrelevant and exploitative.â</p> <p>Radio host and CIA veteran Buck Sexton had a similar take: âAppallingly stupid, and entirely irrelevant, Mrs Clinton She knows nothing about firearms, and even worse, she doesn't care.â</p> <p>White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also pushed back when asked about Clintonâs statements at Mondayâs briefing.</p> <p>âI think before we start trying to talk about the preventions of what took place last night, we need to know more facts, and right now weâre simply not at that point,â Sanders said. âIt is very easy for Mrs. Clinton to criticize and to come out, but I think we need to remember the only person with blood on their hands is that of the shooter, and this isnât a time for us to go after individuals or organizations. I think we can have those policy conversations but today is not that day.â</p> <p>Itâs unclear what weapons the shooter, identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, was using. Witnesses described the sound of rapid automatic gunfire â which many believed to be firecrackers â ringing out as thousands ran for cover. One vendor told Fox News that âit sounded like a machine gun.â Authorities said the shooter had more than 10 rifles in the hotel room where he fired on concert-goers below.</p> <p>The casualties in the attack exceeded those of the Pulse nightclub tragedy in Florida more than a year ago. As with the Pulse attack, the Las Vegas shooting led to prompt calls from Democrats â not just Clinton â for gun legislation, though the party has struggled to tighten laws even when the Obama administration was in power.</p> <p>Connecticutâs senators, who have been especially outspoken on gun control ever since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, were among the first to issue statements Monday.</p> <p>âNowhere but America do horrific large-scale mass shootings happen with this degree of regularity,â Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a statement. âThis must stop. It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren't public policy responses to this epidemic. There are, and the thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference. It's time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.""</p> <p>Connecticutâs other Democratic senator, Richard Blumenthal, issued a similar statement.</p> <p>âIt has been barely a year since what was previously the largest mass shooting in American history â the deadly attack at Pulse nightclub. In the interim, thousands more have been lost to the daily, ruthless toll of gun violence. Still, Congress refuses to act. I am more than frustrated, I am furious,â he said.</p> <p>As the lawmakers seemed to acknowledge, gun legislation stands little chance of passing under a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.</p> <p>After the Pulse shooting, Senate Democrats launched a 15-hour filibuster followed by a Democratic sit-in on the House floor in a high-profile push for gun control legislation. But the divided Senate ultimately rejected all four gun measures put on the floor for a vote.</p> <p>The battle over gun restrictions has, meanwhile, played out in a more substantive fashion on the state level â and at the courts.</p> <p>Most recently, a federal appeals court last week delivered a win for gun rights activists by keeping in place another courtâs ruling that it was unconstitutional for the District of Columbia to require gun owners to provide a âgood reasonâ for legally carrying a concealed weapon in the nationâs capital. The dispute could be on a path to the Supreme Court.</p>",Right,Right,Right,Right

And the problem has been getting worse in recent years.</p> <p>The Last Vegas Review-Journal reported that Las Vegas homicide detectives investigated 168 murders in 2016, nudging out 1996 as the deadliest year on record. (The police department did not provide the paper with records before 1990.) Though the cityâs population has swelled in recent years, population growth doesnât account for the considerable spike in the murder rate between the beginning of this decade, when murders hit a low of 76 in 2012, to last year. Most of the killings take place far from the famous Vegas strip that most tourists are familiar with, where Sunday nightâs massacre unfolded. As of September of last year, 80 percent of the murders involved guns.</p> <p>Las Vegas was one of a few major American cities whose homicide rates contributed to an overall rise in the violent crime rate over the last two years.</p> <p>So far, 2017 is following much the same pattern.</p> <p>What accounts for the proliferation of violence in Las Vegas and other cities is not clear, and the question has been hotly debated. But Clark County sheriff Joseph Lombardo pinned at least some of the blame on gangs that have migrated from California. Domestic violence and young men who are quick to resort to violence appear to be common threads in the killings.</p> <p>A New York Times report from last year painted a picture of the daily toll the violence takes on the cityâs residents and police officers, who had taken pride in the clearance rate of homicide investigations, but now find themselves overstretched.</p> <p>âYou find out there was a minor altercation and someone pulled out a gun,â Lieutenant Daniel McGrath, head of the police departmentâs homicide unit, told the paper. âThey are so quick to resort to violence that it goes from profanity to shooting.â</p> <p>Most of the killings, as with the majority of homicides in America, are committed with run-of-the-mill handguns, not the semi-automatic â or in Paddockâs cause, perhaps fully automatic â weapons that are often the weapon of choice in mass shootings.</p> <p>Las Vegasâs murder rate is likely to ebb and flow, but as long as guns are cheap and easily available, which they are in Nevada, it is likely to remain stubbornly high, and everyday acts of violence will continue to fade into the background.</p>",Left,Center,Left,Left

He isn't going to be president,â she wrote in the May 21 email.</p> <p>Following the release of this and numerous other emails in a WikiLeaks document dump, Fox News confirmed Sunday that Wasserman Schultz will not preside over the Democratic convention. The decision was reached amid pressure from the White House and Hillary Clinton campaign.</p> <p>Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, the former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, will instead preside over the Democratic proceedings as convention chairwoman.</p> <p>The rapid-fire set of developments ahead of the Philadelphia convention kick-off indicate a party in crisis management mode as officials try to prevent anger over the email leak controversy and other issues from disrupting proceedings. The emails only bolstered claims from Sanders â and Republican nominee Donald Trump â that the system was rigged against the Vermont senator.</p> <p>Sanders himself blasted the DNC and Wasserman Schultz in interviews Sunday, demanding her resignation as party chairwoman to boot.</p> <p>âI think [Wasserman Schultz] should resign. Period. And I think we need a new chair who is going the lead us in a very different direction,â Sanders told ABCâs âThis Weekâ on Sunday.</p> <p>Sanders said âthese emails reiterate that reason why she should not be chair.â</p> <p>Sanders is himself set to speak on the opening night of the Democratic convention, securing an A-list position after a hard-fought, ideological primary battle with Clinton.</p> <p>But he hasnât forgiven Wasserman Schultz for an alleged pro-Clinton stance during the campaign. He repeated those claims in the wake of WikiLeaksâ release of roughly 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails.</p> <p>The leaks, which include emails from January 2015 to May 2016, purportedly came from the accounts of seven DNC officials. In a May 5 email, a DNC employee asked a colleague to collect information on his religious beliefs â claiming it might sway voters in West Virginia and Kentucky. In that particular email, Sanders' name was not mentioned, but he was the only other candidate in the race at that time against Clinton.</p> <p>DNC chief financial officer Brad Marshall wrote, âThis would make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.â</p> <p>Others from Wasserman Schultz herself contained very strong language, raising questions about her status as an ostensibly neutral party official.</p> <p>Responding to Sandersâ complaints the party hasnât been fair to him, she wrote to a staffer in an April email: âSpoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.â</p> <p>Responding to the same staffer a month later regarding Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver blaming the Nevada state party for a raucous convention, she wrote, âDamn liar. Particularly scummy that he barely acknowledges the violent and threatening behavior that occurred.â</p> <p>Sanders will be joined Monday night on stage at the Wells Fargo Center by first lady Michelle Obama and several other speakers, according to the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>CNN reported that Wasserman Schultz, however, would not have a speaking role in Philadelphia. Wasserman Schultz is not on the list of speakers released by the DNC.</p> <p>A Democratic source told the network that she had been ""quarantined.""</p> <p>By contrast, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus delivered an address on the closing night of the GOP convention in Cleveland.</p> <p>The Democratic National Committee and Wasserman Schultz already were facing internal unrest over party rules, but the email leak aggravated pro-Sanders Democrats even more.</p> <p>Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, had argued all along that Washington Democrats favored Clinton. Among other decisions, he pointed to Wasserman Schultzâs decision to limit the number of primary debates, which he argued was meant to protect Clinton.</p> <p>Sanders -- who railed against what he called a âriggedâ system throughout his campaign -- has since endorsed Wasserman Schultzâs primary rival in her re-election bid, in another sign of the acrimony between them.</p> <p>Clinton chief strategist Joel Benenson, on ""Fox News Sunday,"" defended the fairness of the primary elections and said the DNC would conduct a full review of the emails. He said people should not jump to conclusions.</p> <p>""The DNCâs impact in these things is minimal compared to the results. What candidates and campaigns spend and do on the ground, talking to voters day in and day out, thatâs what determines who wins,â he said.</p> <p>That Sanders gets a prime-time speaking spot is also significant, considering the rival campaigns for weeks negotiated his primary exit strategy, with Sanders insisting that at least some of his progressive agenda -- including free college education, better international trade deals and more social and economic equality -- be included in the party platform.</p> <p>He ultimately endorsed Clinton a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Fox News' Chad Pergram, Garrett Tenney and Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.</p>",Center,Right,Right,Right

Will this complicate passage?,"<p>Senate Republicans on Tuesday revised their tax cut bill to include a repeal of Obamacareâs individual mandate â a bold move that frees up more money for deeper tax cuts and takes a whack at the health care law they have repeatedly tried but failed to repeal.</p> <p>President Trump had been pushing the idea for weeks, eyeing the more than $300 billion in savings over the next decade that could be pumped into more tax cuts for average Americans.</p> <p>Republican leaders on Capitol Hill had resisted, but with little hope of getting Democrats on board and looking to rally their own troops to pass the bill, the Senateâs top brass relented.</p> <p>âWeâre optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful,â said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.</p> <p>Democrats blasted the move, saying it adds insult to an already injurious tax cut package that delivers most of its bang to businesses.</p> <p>Insurers also objected, saying ending the Obamacare mandate will chase younger, healthy people out of the markets, leaving them with only older, sicker customers and thus ruin the economics of the 2010 health care law.</p> <p>âRepublicans just canât help themselves. Theyâre so determined to provide tax giveaways to the rich that theyâre willing to raise premiums on millions of middle-class Americans and kick 13 million people off their health care,â said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.</p> <p>He predicted that the bill would sour more Americans on the Republicansâ plans.</p> <p>But Republican leaders are counting on the move to win over wavering senators, saying the savings from nixing the mandate can be pumped back into even bigger tax cuts for the middle class.</p> <p>Before the mandate, the Senate plan amounts to a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years, with about 60 percent going to businesses and the rest going to individual taxpayers. The plan slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and lowers the top individual rate from 39.6 percent to 38.5 percent while adjusting other individual tax brackets so they kick in at higher income thresholds.</p> <p>Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch said including the mandate repeal allows Republicans to be even more ambitious with their plan.</p> <p>âBy scrapping this unpopular tax from an unworkable law, we not only ease the financial burdens already associated with the mandate, but also generate additional revenue to provide more tax relief to â¦ individuals,â Mr. Hatch said.</p> <p>The 20 percent corporate rate would be permanent but the new individual income tax rates would expire after 2025 under the modified outline Mr. Hatch released Tuesday evening.</p> <p>The new plan costs about $1.415 trillion â down from the $1.496 trillion plan rolled out last week.</p> <p>Mr. Hatch also announced other revisions Tuesday, including a doubling of the child tax credit from the current $1,000 to $2,000 â up from $1,650 in the first plan â and some other tweaks to individual tax rates.</p> <p>Another revision makes changes so more âpass-throughâ companies that file their taxes as individuals can claim a new 17.4 percent deduction Republicans say is designed to give a boost to small businesses.</p> <p>âThe pass-through provisions in the chairmanâs mark have been further streamlined to ensure these critical job creators have access to the resources they need to further expand, help hire new workers, and increase employee take-home pay,â Mr. Hatch said.</p> <p>The plan also eliminates a number of deductions, such as the one for state and local taxes paid, and uses the savings to pay for lowering the rates.</p> <p>With the plan bumping up against the $1.5 trillion cap set in the 2018 budget for tax cuts, lawmakers were left searching for new ways to free up money to do even more for the middle class.</p> <p>Enter the individual mandate plan, which the Congressional Budget Office said would save the government more than $300 billion over the next 10 years by freeing people from the obligation to have health care coverage â and the government from the responsibility of subsidizing much of that coverage.</p> <p>Some 13 million fewer people would have coverage in 2027 without the pressure from the mandate.</p> <p>Some Republicans had long pushed for the move, saying it was the natural solution to their failure this year to repeal Obamacare.</p> <p>Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, Pennsylvania Republican and a member of the tax-writing finance committee, said the mandate is based on a âflawed premiseâ that the federal government should force Americans to buy a product they might not want.</p> <p>âIncluding the repeal of the tax penalty in our pro-growth tax reform bill gives direct relief to hardworking Pennsylvanians and assists in making permanent desperately needed changes to our outdated tax code so American businesses can be globally competitive once again,â said Mr. Toomey.</p> <p>Democrats, though, framed the move as cutting a government benefit for average Americans in order to give corporations a tax reduction.</p> <p>âThis is a con job on the American people and proves that Republicansâ only agenda is putting an economic double standard into black letter law,â said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.</p> <p>Republicans hope to move their broader bill through committee this week, with possible floor action the week after Thanksgiving, as they look to get a final package to Mr. Trumpâs desk by the end of the year.</p> <p>The admittedly ambitious time frame comes as some Republicans view the tax overhaul effort as the partyâs last real chance to give voters a reason to turn out in next yearâs midterm elections, after their monthslong effort to repeal Obamacare in its entirety stalled out over the summer.</p> <p>The House tax bill that advanced out of the Ways and Means Committee last week did not include a repeal of the mandate, though some Republicans said they would like it to be part of the discussion as leaders prepare for a floor vote in the House this week.</p> <p>House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said Tuesday that the House is pushing the bill âas we have it,â though he described things as a work in progress.</p> <p>He said differences between the House and Senate versions can ultimately get hammered out in a bicameral conference committee once each chamber passes its respective plan.</p> <p>âSo we are just getting this process going. We think itâs very, very important we produce this.

As DNC chair, Wasserman Schultz is still expected to formally gavel the convention in and out.</p> <p>The DNC is scrambling to contain the fallout after over 20,000 internal emails were posted online by Wikileaks, revealing a great deal of embarrassing material in the process. One exchange shows DNC officials creating fake Craigslist ads to smear Republican nominee Donald Trump, while another shows Wasserman Schultz herself sending an irate email to NBC News political director Chuck Todd after she was criticized on MSNBC.</p> <p>The most damaging revelations, though, relate to the DNCâs handling of the presidential primaries. Even though the DNC is supposed to be neutral in the primary race, the emails repeatedly reveal overt DNC bias against Sen. Bernie Sanders and in favor of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>In one exchange, DNC officials plotted to sabotage Sanders in certain primaries by getting reporters to ask about his religious beliefs, in the hopes of revealing him as an atheist. In another, they talk about how to create a media ânarrativeâ portraying the Sanders campaign as an incompetent mess unable to gets its act together.</p> <p>After a drawn-out primary battle, Clinton finally secured Sandersâs endorsement just two weeks ago, but the new revelations threaten to alienate his supporters all over again. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Saturday someone would have to be âaccountableâ for what the emails show.</p> <p>CNN says Wasserman Schultzâs canceled speech is a concession to appease Sanders. Itâs also hoped that keeping her out of the limelight will prevent âchaosâ on the convention floor, should she be loudly booed by delegates sympathetic to Sanders.</p> <p>Send tips to [email protected].</p> <p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

c5b2834c-8357-4ef8-989a-5114ea6eb6ce,"Haley: âYes,â We Had To Twist Arms To Get China, Russia On Board With North Korea Sanctions",Donald Trump warned North Korea after reports revealed that they are moving closer to becoming a nuclear power.,"<p>U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley speaks while Japan's U.N. Ambassador Koro Bessho (R) and South Korea's U.N. Ambassador Cho Tae-yul (L) look on during a press encounter ahead of an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council at the United Nations in New York, U.S., May 16, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY</p> <p>U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley revealed Monday that the U.S. had to twist China and Russiaâs arms to get them on board with the new sanctions on North Korea.</p> <p>North Korea conducted two tests of an intercontinental ballistic missile in July, escalating the military threat. Prior to this test, North Korea tested several new short-, medium-, and intermediate-range missiles. Pyongyang has developed an arsenal of ballistic missiles that it can use against its neighbors and the U.S. As North Korea is close to a viable nuclear deterrent, the U.S. pushed the U.N. Security Council to act, and that required convincing China and Russia.</p> <p>The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved Resolution 2371, the âthe single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regimeâ and âthe most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generationâ over the weekend, according to Haley. The resolution is expected to reduce North Koreaâs $3 billion export revenue by roughly one-third.</p> <p>âThe international community is standing with one voice. China didnât pull off. Russia didnât pull off. And all of the Security Council and the international community said thatâs enough,â Haley said to Fox Newsâ Dana Perino Monday evening. She explained that North Koreaâs repeated provocations are trying the patience of the international community. âItâs reckless. Itâs irresponsible. And the international community really laid down the groundwork of saying weâre not going to watch you do this anymore.â</p> <p>North Korea responded with its usual brand of aggression in the wake of the latest round of sanctions. North Korea will âmake the U.S. pay dearly for all the heinous crime it commits against the state and people of this country,â North Korean state-media warned Monday. North Korea may also be moving anti-ship cruise missiles into place along its eastern shores, according to Fox Newsâ Lucas Tomlinson, citing military intelligence reports.</p> <p>âTheyâre going to threaten, â¦ but weâre not going to run scared from them,â Haley explained.</p> <p>In response to the growing threat from North Korea, the Pentagon is working with counterparts in Seoul to give South Korean missiles a boost. South Korea wants heavier conventional warheads for its long-range missiles to ensure that they can adequately penetrate hardened North Korean defenses at a distance.</p> <p>âOur job is to defend not just the United States, but our allies,â Haley told Fox, adding, âWe have to protect our friends, and weâre going to continue to do that.â</p> <p>As for sanctions, Haley explained that the U.S. will need to stay after China to ensure that they fully implement sanctions against their nuclear neighbor. âChina stepped up and said, âWe will follow through on these sanctionsâ,â she told Perino, âAnd now we have to just stay on them to make sure they do that.â</p> <p>The North Korea problem is one that has puzzled world leaders for decades, but now that the North possesses nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of striking targets in Northeast Asia and across the vast Pacific Ocean, the situation is even more complicated. The U.S. and its allies are praying for a diplomatic solution, recognizing that any sort of military solution would be catastrophic and, in the words of Secretary of Defense James Mattis, âtragic on an unbelievable scale.â</p> <p>The challenge is that North Korea believes its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles are essential for its survival, and it has said numerous times that it is unwilling to negotiate away its weapons, especially now that it is so close to a reliable nuclear deterrent.</p> <p>Follow Ryan on Twitter</p> <p>Send tips to [email protected] dailycallernewsfoundation.org.</p> <p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

c608ba67-4b29-4e47-b8c0-b097b841676a,"Trump Campaign Splits With Trump, Disavows Birtherism","Donald Trump passed up yet another opportunity to say he accepts the fact that President Barack Obama was born in the United States, promising to make a ""major statement"" on Friday morning.","<p>Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</p> <p>Everyone knows that two wrongs donât make a right, but maybe that equation changes when you tack on multiple statements that are completely wrong? Thatâs the strategy the Trump team tested on Thursday night after the candidate refused to say whether President Obama was born in the United States, even after several top surrogates reported that heâs rejected birtherism.</p> <p>During an interview conducted while Donald Trumpâs private plane was idling on a tarmac, the Washington Postâs Robert Costa asked if Trump would finally admit that Obama was born in the United States. âIâll answer that question at the right time,â Trump said. âI just donât want to answer it yet.â</p> <p>Costa then asked if that means Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was wrong when she said last week that Trump now believes Obama was born in Hawaii. âItâs okay. Sheâs allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs. I want to focus on other things,â Trump said.</p> <p>Other Trump surrogates have tried to quash the birther controversy in the last week, with Mike Pence saying he âacceptsâ Obamaâs birthplace, Rudy Giuliani falsely claiming that Trump rejected birtherism two years ago, and Ben Carson calling on Trump to apologize.</p> <p>Trump explained, once again, that he has simply decided not to discuss his years-long effort to delegitimize the first black president of the United States. âI donât talk about it anymore. The reason I donât is because then everyone is going to be talking about it as opposed to jobs, the military, the vets, security,â he told Costa.</p> <p>Many on Twitter speculated that Trumpâs hesitance meant the master showman was waiting to renounce birtherism in a dramatic debate moment. Then the Trump campaign revealed that the âright timeâ was actually a few hours later on Thursday night.</p> <p>Full Trump campaign statement (note this is not from Trump himself but from communications director) pic.twitter.com/oLtXEiWaFe â James Pindell (@JamesPindell) September 16, 2016</p> <p>But upon further inspection, itâs campaign spokesman Jason Miller whoâs disavowed birtherism, not Donald Trump. While the statement says âMr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States,â there is no quote from the candidate clarifying his previous remarks. And while in a normal campaign you can assume that the candidate agrees with statements released by their campaign, thatâs not the case with Trump. Allow him to explain:</p> <p>Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me! â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2016</p> <p>Furthermore, Millerâs statement contains multiple incorrect statements. First, it claims birtherism originated with Hillary Clintonâs 2008 campaign. Trump has made this accusation before, though both the Washington Post and Politifact concluded that while questions about Obamaâs birthplace did originate with Clinton supporters, there is âno direct tie to Clinton or her 2008 campaign.â</p> <p>Itâs interesting that the Trump campaign now characterizes birtherism as an âugly incident,â but the assertion that Trump considered the case closed once Obama produced his birth certificate in 2011 is untrue. (And the idea that he did President Obama a favor is laughable.) Hereâs Trump in 2012:</p> <p>When I was 18, people called me Donald Trump. When he was 18, @BarackObama was Barry Soweto. Weird. â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2012</p> <p>An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud. â Donald J.

On camera. And admit he was wrong for trying to delegitimize the country's first African American President â Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) September 16, 2016</p> <p>After years of questioning President Obamaâs citizenship, Trump shouldnât be celebrated if he offers a halfhearted apology, and journalists shouldnât let his campaign spread the lie that he actually dropped the birther issue in 2011. But maybe they will. According to CNNâs Don Lemon, Millerâs statement means that birtherism is âdone, this issue is over,â and we have Trump to âcredit for at least now heâs admitted it, I mean somewhat. You give him some credit for that.â</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left
c6b09540-12f4-44b2-b28d-d2c15176288c,"The Russia Dossier Story: A Perfect Storm of Clinton Deception, Media Irresponsibility, and Democratic Moral Blindness","Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee hired a Washington firm to research and create a dossier that accused Donald Trump of having multiple ties to Russia, including allegations of collusion during the election.","<p>Remember that infamous Russian âdossier,â the unverified document that BuzzFeed unceremoniously dumped into the public square earlier this year? You might recall it as making a series of incredibly salacious and completely unproven accusations against the sitting president of the United States. Well, it turns out that it was a piece of partisan opposition research, bought and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, both of which then denied having anything to do with it after the fact.</p> <p>Last night the Washington Post reported that the Clinton campaign and the DNC used a lawyer named Marc Elias to retain the oppo-research firm Fusion GPS to conduct research on the Trump campaign (the firm had previously worked on behalf of a still-unidentified Republican to investigate Trump). Fusion GPS then hired a former intelligence officer named Christopher Steele, who conducted an investigation and authored the dossier. According to the Post, the Clinton campaign and the DNC used the law firm to pay Fusion GPS right until the end of October 2016.</p> <p>As my colleague Andrew McCarthy notes, itâs a clever arrangement. The use of the law firm adds a layer of deniability, and when controversy arises, Fusion GPS is able to appeal to attorney-client privilege to shield itself from scrutiny.</p> <p>It would be easy, at this point, to start to wander down the rabbit hole, to wonder how much of the so-called âRussia controversyâ is based on the Clinton campaignâs opposition research, but letâs not speculate. The truth will emerge. Instead, letâs do something else: Letâs consider how the Russian-dossier story has thus far represented a perfect storm of classic Clintonism, media irresponsibility, and Democratic moral blindness.</p> <p>First, the Clintonism. The New York Timesâs Maggie Haberman responded to the Post story with a perfect tweet:</p> <p>Folks involved in funding this lied about it, and with sanctimony, for a year https://t.co/vXKRV1wRJc â Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) October 24, 2017</p> <p>âSanctimonious lyingâ is Clintonworldâs M.O. From Bill to Hillary to key members of her team, they lie constantly, repetitively, and with style, and the lies often conceal no-holds-barred, bare-knuckle politics designed to win races and destroy political opponents.</p> <p>The lies here are important. Itâs one thing to review a dossier compiled by a âformer intelligence agentâ and consider its contents as the product of an objective process. Itâs another thing entirely to review that same work as the direct product of an opposing campaignâs opposition research. The goal of an opposition researcher is to collect everything and share everything with the client. A proper intelligence analysis, however, involves separating truth from fiction and provable claims from unverifiable allegations.</p> <p>Those who pitched the Russian dossier treated it not as opposition research but rather as a form of intelligence report. It had distinctive formatting. It used terms of art. It looked like a government document. How many people did it fool?</p> <p>Then thereâs the media irresponsibility. There are reasons why news outlets donât simply publish partisan opposition-research files: theyâre full of rumor, innuendo, and sometimes outright lies. Campaigns routinely keep gigabytes of information about political opponents, and those files can contain the most fantastical of allegations. Yes, there are often true allegations alongside the scurrilous ones, but responsible journalists research those allegations before publishing them. Responsible journalists know to treat dirt from opposing campaigns with special skepticism. They donât simply take a campaignâs work, upload it to their servers, and press âpublish.â</p> <p>It was shameful for BuzzFeed to publish the dossier then. Itâs even more shameful now.</p> <p>Yet thatâs exactly what BuzzFeed did when it published the dossier in January. We knew then that it was the product of Trump opponents. (After all, which Trump friend would commission such a report?) We did not know it was the product of the Clinton campaign. A news outlet took a rumor-filled document of then-unknown origin, failed to verify its claims, and published it anyway. At the time, BuzzFeed called its work âferocious reporting,â but anyone can publish an opposition-research file. It was shameful for BuzzFeed to publish the dossier then. Itâs even more shameful now.</p> <p>Finally, letâs talk for a moment about Democratic moral blindness. One of the more incredible aspects of the emerging post-election narrative is the hero-worship that greets Hillary in some progressive circles. Sure, there are Bernie Bros and others who are bitterly angry at her, but others greet her with hugs, cheers, and tears.</p> <p>This is absurd. Itâs as if some Democrats see the 2016 election as a Lord of the Ringsâstyle struggle of good versus evil, Frodo battling Gollum at the Cracks of Doom, only to see Gollum win. Nope, sorry. This was Gollum versus Gollum from the word go. The two most dishonest and disliked politicians in America battled in the sewers of American politics, and heroes were hard to find. Iâm sorry, Democrats. You know how I feel about Trump, but lies and slander about Hillary are no more virtuous than lies and slander about Trump.</p> <p>We donât know what role the Russia dossier has played or is playing in the Russia investigation. We donât know yet which parts (if any) are true. Indeed, when it comes to the full extent of Russian efforts to sow chaos in our election, influence the Clintons, or influence the Trumps, weâre like the proverbial blind men feeling different parts of the elephant. We know so little. But we did learn a bit more last night, and what we learned undermines the dossier, indicts the Clinton campaign, and helps Donald Trump.</p> <p>READ MORE:</p> <p>When Scandals Collide</p> <p>Trump: Travails and Opportunities</p> <p>The Obama Administrationâs Uranium One Scandal</p> <p>â David French is a senior writer for National Review, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, and an attorney.</p>",Center,Right,Right,Right

Desch, director of the International Security Center at the University of Notre Dame, said Mr. Trump will succeed in his first U.N. speech if it looks like the world is with him.</p> <p>âHe can look statesmanlike by rallying the international community around this issue rhetorically with no real expectation of having to achieve anything,â he said. âBashing [North Korea] is what economists call a âsolidarity good.â The purpose is to unite the group, not achieve anything beyond it.â</p> <p>A week ago, the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which includes China and Russia, unanimously adopted its ninth sanctions resolution since 2006 over North Koreaâs nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</p> <p>North Korea has not been deterred. The North made its 15th missile test last week, lobbing one over northern Japan for a second time. A nuclear weapon detonated early this month, which Pyongyang claimed was a hydrogen bomb, was its most powerful to date.</p> <p>As Mr. Trump prepared his speech, which he spent hours crafting to present his vision of America to the world, the U.S. military was conducting exercises flying advanced bombers and stealth jets over the Korean Peninsula.</p> <p>The joint exercises with South Korea presented a demonstration of U.S. military power just days after North Koreaâs latest missile test.</p> <p>In the speech, Mr. Trump also is expected to address Iran, a sponsor of terrorism and a destabilizing actor throughout the Middle East. The Trump administration is mulling whether to certify Tehranâs compliance with an Obama-era deal to slow the Iranian nuclear weapons program.</p> <p>Mr. Trump has said Iran is not living up to the spirit of the agreement.</p> <p>The speech will attempt to rally other countries to do their part. Rather than minimizing the role of the United Nations, the official said, Mr. Trump will present âan optimistic vision for international cooperation based on respecting individual sovereignty.â</p> <p>âIt is a shared menace,â the official said. âNations cannot be bystanders to history. If we donât confront these threats now, they will only gather force and become more formidable.â</p> <p>A united front could lay the groundwork for a diplomatic path to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea crisis, said Mona Khalil of Independent Diplomat, an international relations consulting firm.</p> <p>âEven when fully and meaningfully implemented, sanctions alone do not work. They never have. Such sticks must be coupled with one or more of the following carrots: respect, recognition, negotiation and/or nonaggression,â Ms. Khalil said.</p> <p>Mr. Trump was in a position to forge a consensus with China and Russia, as well as with South Korea and Japan, on what North Korea must do to get a seat at the negotiating table, she said.</p> <p>âTo offer any such incentive, however, there must first be a viable table. As such, the U.S. and China must stand together and the five must present a united front before a diplomatic breakthrough is possible,â she said. âChina is the essential partner in that endeavor; to be a reliable one, China will need consistency and demand respect from its American counterpart.â</p> <p>Mr. Trump prodded Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call Monday from the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. In the call, the two leaders committed to âmaximizing pressureâ on North Korea through vigorous enforcement of the U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to the White House.</p> <p>However, Chinaâs Communist Party newspaper earlier had blasted the U.S. for demanding that Beijing increase the pressure on Pyongyang to halt its development of nuclear weapons.</p> <p>âThe so-called Chinaâs responsibility theory is essentially moral kidnapping,â the Peopleâs Daily said in an editorial. It also said that sanctions should not harm âlegitimate economic and trade exchanges between North Korea and the outside worldâ or the lives of everyday people.</p> <p>China accounts for about 90 percent of North Koreaâs trade and sends practically free crude oil shipments to the North. Beijing has been increasingly frustrated with North Koreaâs nuclear drive, but it still doesnât want the North to collapse. China fears the results would include a wave of refugees crossing the border into China and American troops moving into North Korea.</p> <p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the military threats by North Korea and the U.S. were counterproductive.</p>",Center,Right,Right,Right

cfe253f1-9e08-4dab-90e8-9571f698f46d,Joe Arpaioâs Pardon Is Donald Trumpâs Gravest Abuse of Power Yet,"President Trump issued his first presidential pardon to Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court. Arpaio is the controversial former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona.","<p>Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p> <p>Days before Donald Trump was sworn in as president, the Supreme Court heard the very last case of the Obama administration â a civil-rights dispute over whether high-ranking federal officials can be held accountable for violating peopleâs constitutional rights. Justice Stephen Breyer, an institutional pragmatist, seemed to seize on the case to portend the heavy lift that awaited the justice system in the years ahead: âThereâs no blank check, even for the president,â he said during the hearing. âAnd if thereâs no blank check, that means sometimes they can go too far. And if they have gone too far, it is our job to say that.â</p> <p>The tragedy of Trumpâs âfull pardonâ of disgraced Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio is that thereâs nothing anyone can do to check it. Certainly not the courts: The pardon is not only unconditional and irrevocable, but also an affront to judicial authority writ large â part and parcel of the presidentâs ongoing feud with federal judges who donât rule as heâd like.</p> <p>The reason Arpaioâs reprieve is a slap in the face to the courts is that the crime originated in the courts. U.S. District Judge Murray Snow â a deeply conservative George W. Bush appointee who for years oversaw a civil case accusing the sheriff of trampling on Latinosâ constitutional rights â held him in contempt of court for doing precisely the thing he was being sued over. Snow had had it with Arpaioâs recalcitrance: He and his cronies âhave demonstrated a persistent disregard for the orders of the Court, as well as an intention to violate and manipulate the laws and policies regulating their conduct,â he wrote in a contempt order last year.</p> <p>Arpaioâs trail of racist lawlessness is endless. But this was the first time that his disregard for the rule of law rose to the level of a criminal offense â Snow found his violations serious enough under federal law that he felt a referral to the Department of Justice was necessary. And once all was said and done, it was Trumpâs own Justice Department that prosecuted Arpaio and scored a conviction against him before a different judge just last month. The evidence was conclusive: âBecause the Court finds that Defendant willfully violated an order of the court, it finds Defendant guilty of criminal contempt.â</p> <p>None of that matters now. Trumpâs pardon short-circuits the entire process: Arpaio hadnât even been sentenced yet. The pardon effectively disrupts the work of career DOJ lawyers who were preparing for the sentencing phase; of court officers who were readying a pre-sentence report to guide the sentencing judge; of Arpaioâs own lawyers, who just last week filed court papers seeking to quash Arpaioâs conviction; of the judge who was due to sentence the sheriff in October. The wheels of justice ground to a halt simply because the nationâs chief executive said so. As with other matters that are still within the purview of prosecutors, like Bob Muellerâs inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice in the Russia probe, Trump is once again inserting himself in criminal proceedings that are yet to run their course. As one former White House counsel put it in Lawfare, âa pardon will have every appearance of being direct interference in the administration of justice.â</p> <p>Trump may very well believe that Arpaio was adjudged a convicted criminal simply for âdoing his job,â as he told a cheerful crowd in Phoenix earlier this week. The two share a bond over rounding up bad hombres, after all, and then some. But no law-enforcement officerâs job description includes a carte blanche to violate constitutional rights, let alone flout court orders to stop doing so. On its own terms, the pardon flies in the face of Trumpâs purported law-and-order presidency.</p> <p>Maybe Trump meant for the pardon to be interpreted as a reward for Arpaioâs faithful surrogacy during the presidential campaign. Maybe itâs a presidential show of gratitude for being the only ally with the âgutsâ to not give up on the birther crusade against President Obama. Or maybe Trump is simply being Trump â playing to his base by pardoning the unpardonable just because he can, and because it would drive the other side mad. âWe polled the race stuff and it didnât matter,â Stephen Bannon infamously told Joshua Green. More red meat for the red-hat crowd.</p> <p>No one knows what other clemency initiatives Trump has in store for what remains of his presidency, and this one in particular, egregious though it may be, will not result in impeachment. But itâs a harbinger of whatâs to come for a president and an administration that will soon be forced to reckon more and more with another lawman who will be sure to treat every interference â and preemptive pardon â as the obstruction that it is. No blank checks there.</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left

The law is also expected to have a significant effect on hours worked, the nonpartisan budget office said in a regular update to its budget projections released Tuesday. With the expansion of insurance coverage, more workers will choose not to work and others will choose to work fewer hours than they might have otherwise, it said. The decline in hours worked will translate into a loss of the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time positions by 2024, the budget office said.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>You remember the sales pitch, right?</p> <p>âIt will create 4 million jobs, 400,000 jobs almost immediately,â Pelosi promised.</p> <p>Also remember the pledge about how Obamacare would help the government save money?

Instead, the CBO projects that subsidies will account for increasing chunks of deficit spending, starting at $20 billion this year and steadily increasing to $159 billion in 2024, for a collective deficit of just under $1.2 trillion. The cumulative deficit from the ACA for the next decade could reach $1.35 trillion.</p> <p>UPDATE: A reader reminds me of Obamaâs pledge that âhealth care reform will not add one dime to our deficit.â</p> <p>FACT CHECK: True.

Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, on Friday.</p> <p>Rogers, whose committee is effectively short-circuited by the three-month stopgap bill, said almost nothing about the Affordable Care Act, but House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) made clear that the main point of the measure is to block the health care law.</p> <p>""This resolution will also protect the working middle class from the devastating effects of Obamacare,"" said Cantor. ""Let's defund this law now, and protect the American people from the economic calamity that we know Obamacare will create.""</p> <p>The vote marked the 42nd time that the House Republican conference has said yes to gutting Obamacare. While some tweaks have been made to the program, the Senate has ignored nearly everything the House has pushed for.</p> <p>Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.), who faces reelection in a district that Obama carried in 2012, was the only Republican to vote against the bill. Rigell has bucked his party on fiscal matters before; he appeared with the president at an event in February opposing sequestration and even took a ride aboard Air Force One.</p> <p>Rigell released a statement in which he said he agreed that Obamacare should be defunded, but couldn't support a bill that would set government spending levels at sequester levels.</p> <p>""This [continuing resolution] fails to address the sequester that is negatively impacting those who wear our nationâs uniform and is the result of Congress' inability to pass the 12 appropriations bills necessary to properly fund the government on time,"" Rigell said. ""What is needed is a comprehensive solution to our nationâs fiscal challenges, including a replacement for sequestration.""</p> <p>On the Democratic side, Reps. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D-N.C.) were the only two lawmakers to vote in favor of the bill.

Unless Congress steps in, ending the program could put nearly 800,000 undocumented young people at risk of deportation and unable to work legally when their two-year permits expire.</p> <p>Obama said it was a âpolitical decision, and a moral questionâ â and one of basic decency.</p> <p>âTo target these young people is wrong â because they have done nothing wrong,â he said in a statement. âIt is self-defeating â because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way weâd want our own kids to be treated. Itâs about who we are as a people â and who we want to be.â</p> <p>Obama started the program in 2012 and urged undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to come forward to the government, pay a fee and undergo a background check before receiving a two-year work permit and reprieve from deportation.</p> <p>He did so after legislative efforts to help Dreamers â which are being revived now because of Trumpâs decisions â failed multiple times, as he noted in his statement.</p> <p>â³[B]ecause it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country,â Obama said.</p> <p>To target hopeful young strivers who grew up here is wrong, because theyâve done nothing wrong. My statement: https://t.co/TCxZdld7L4 â Barack Obama (@BarackObama) September 5, 2017</p> <p>Trump promised during his presidential campaign to immediately end DACA, but Obama urged him not to, both publicly and in private conversations. In his final press conference as president, Obama said he would speak out if Trump targeted Dreamers âwho have grown up here and for all practical purposes are American kids and send them someplace else when they love this country; they are our kidsâ friends and their classmates, and are now entering into community colleges or, in some cases, serving in our military.â</p> <p>âThe notion that we would just arbitrarily, or because of politics, punish those kids when they didnât do anything wrong themselves I think would be something that would merit me speaking out,â Obama said at the time.</p> <p>By ending DACA, Trump dismantled one of Obamaâs most significant immigration policy achievements. Trump already dramatically reshaped immigration enforcement from how it was under Obama, who began his presidency with record deportation numbers before changing enforcement priorities to focus on certain undocumented immigrants over others.</p> <p>Trump immediately eliminated those priorities as president and has detained and deported people whom Obama allowed to remain in the country if they checked in with the government or met other requirements.</p> <p>Trump said that Congress should act on Dreamers, although his statements were vague and the only legislation he mentioned specifically during his statement on DACA focused on limiting legal immigration, not actually undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>Obama said it was time for Congress to act as well.</p> <p>âNow that the White House has shifted its responsibility for these young people to Congress, itâs up to Members of Congress to protect these young people and our future,â Obama said. âIâm heartened by those whoâve suggested that they should. And I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel.â</p> <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, who served with Obama, similarly condemned Trumpâs decision to end DACA.</p>",Left,Center,Left,Left

There has been a flurry of legislative efforts across the states to increase incomes for the lowest paid workers:</p> <p>Eighteen cities and states are looking at wages over $10 an hour, with the greatest number focused on $10.10 an hour. That wage would not just put it in line with where it would be if it had kept up with inflation since the 1960s. It would also lift nearly 5 million people out of poverty and boost economic growth by more than $22 billion.</p> <p>Conservatives often oppose an increase in the minimum wage because they say it would hurt jobs. But recent studies found that increasing the minimum wage, even during times of high unemployment, doesnât have a negative impact on job growth. States that raised their wages even had slightly above average job growth. Another review of the research found that any negative effects on employment from raising minimum wages were âtoo modest to have meaningful consequences for public policy.â A higher wage can even have benefits for businesses, such as increasing demand, reducing turnover, and encouraging employees to work harder.</p>",Center,Left,Left,Left

The intelligence reports were also reportedly labeled a low classification level, so they would be accessible to more government workers â and some European allies.</p> <p>The Obama officials reportedly wanted to make sure that as many individuals â with the proper clearances â could see the intelligence.

ecc2b3f8-e42d-4c23-8832-e652536e843a,We Canât Predict Who Will Commit a Mass Shooting. Gun Control Is the Only Way Out.,Shooting in Oregon,"<p>Photo: Mike Sullivan/Roseburg News-Review via AP</p> <p>As a shaken President Obama put it in his address Thursday night, the reaction to yesterdayâs mass murder at Umpqua Community College has taken a sickeningly familiar course: âSomehow this has become routine,â he said. âThe reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. Weâve become numb to this.â He argued, as he has with increasing forcefulness over the course of his presidency, that gun control needs to be a big part of the solution. âThe United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws â even in the face of repeated mass killings.â</p> <p>It would be nice to think we could sidestep the gun-control issues given the vehemence of the anti-gun-control lobby. That was the story I hoped to write today: Knowing what we know about the impossibility of passing any significant gun-control legislation, at least given the current incarnation of Congress and the current strength of the National Rifle Association, what else can we do about mass shootings? How can we better predict them, in a behavioral sense?</p> <p>I reached out via email to Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a Columbia University psychiatrist who specializes in researching attacks like yesterdayâs. He responded bluntly: âWhen I heard the news of the Oregon shootings, I thought, Iâm done talking to reporters about the causes of violence.â Instead, he said heâd prepared a one-size-fits-all statement for the media that concluded, âIf you tell me that thereâs nothing we can do about guns, Iâd say then weâre done. Weâve conceded that we are willing to tolerate periodic slaughters of the innocent. Thereâs nothing more to say.ââ</p> <p>The problem, as he explained in a follow-up phone call, is that any attempt to predict who is most likely to commit a mass shooting â and therefore prevent it â runs up against the fact that these events are extremely rare, and as a result have only the broadest, least useful risk factors associated with them. (Mass shootings are generally defined as shootings in which four people or more die in a public place, and Appelbaum explained that stranger mass shootings like the one that occurred yesterday have somewhat different behavioral pathways as compared to multiple murders of, say, family members or co-workers, which are far more common events that donât seize national attention quite as strongly as seemingly random ones.)</p> <p>The risk factors that are linked to these events â basically, being an angry young man â are so widespread in the population, he explained, and so weakly predictive of an individual actually committing a mass shooting as to be practically useless. âThe answer is yes, at least of the most highly publicized, most fear-inducing cases of stranger shootings, by and large they are angry young men,â said Appelbaum. âBut that doesnât get you very far, because there are a lot of angry young men who are angry for all kinds of reasons, and unless one wants to lock them all up or put them all under 24-hour surveillance, itâs really impossible to build on a description that general to come up with effective preventative approaches.â</p> <p>Once you move past that incredibly broad category, he explained, âyouâre really into murky territory where youâre identifying categories that some people fall into and others donât,â he said. Take mental illness: While more and better-funded treatment for mental illness is obviously a good thing, Appelbaum said it just doesnât have much of a direct connection to mass shootings. Sometimes mass shooters have a history of mental illness, but â[l]ots of people who commit mass killings are not mentally ill in any classical way,â Appelbaum said, noting that he wished Obama hadnât mentioned mental illness in his address last night.</p> <p>Appelbaum also said he didnât take cultural explanations for mass shootings all that seriously. âThere have been commentators who have written for years about the peculiar violence-prone aspects of American culture, which they trace back to the frontier or even earlier.â These ideas âare interesting in a descriptive sense, but I donât think they tell us much about what we should be doing about the problem. Because changing the influence of 400 years of American culture is even harder than doing something about reducing the number of guns in circulation.â</p> <p>As Appelbaum sees it, despite the endless, whirling conversations about the causes of mass shootings, thereâs just no serious approach to the issues that doesnât involve gun control. He mentioned that, despite widespread beliefs otherwise, there actually arenât major differences between the overall rates of violence in the U.S. as compared to the rest of the developed world. Where the U.S. differs is in the number of homicides, and to Appelbaum that is largely attributable to the free flow of powerful guns. Every country has its angry young men; every country has various cultural forces that likely exacerbate violent peopleâs grievances; not every country makes it easy for anyone to get a gun. Some countries, like Australia, reacted forcefully to mass shootings by restricting the availability of powerful weaponry, and Appelbaum thinks the data is clear that these approaches work (Margaret Hartmann dug into the debate behind the Australian and British reactions to mass shootings Thursday).</p> <p>Appelbaum made it clear he didnât see gun control as an instant panacea. âI donât think anyone could say honestly that if we tighten up on the availability of guns and the ease of purchasing them, and reduce the number of weapons that are largely produced to kill large numbers of people, that the problem will go away completely,â he said. âI donât think it will go away completely â¦ there will be some people who will be able to get their hands on guns and be able to do horrible things with them. On the other hand, the harder we make it, logic and the Australian experience certainly suggest, the fewer such episodes there will be. So perfect safety is, Iâm afraid, unobtainable in this world, but that doesnât mean we canât start making the situation better by just making it harder and having fewer guns in circulation.â</p> <p>The depressing thing about Appelbaumâs argument is that the underlying idea â weâll likely never be able to predict who will commit a mass shooting â isnât new to experts. He sent me to a Psychiatric Services article by a colleague, Dr. Jeffrey W. Swanson of Duke University, in which Swanson made the same points. âProfiles of mass killers suggest that they tend to be troubled young men,â he wrote in 2011. âThis does not tell us which one of the very large population of troubled young men in the world will become the next mass killer; the vast majority of them will not.â</p> <p>Appelbaum and Swanson and other researchers, then, are forced to repeatedly re-debunk an idea that, in their minds, already has been shown to not make much sense â an idea that reporters and others grapple with only because a much simpler, more clear-cut solution has been deemed impossible for political reasons. Itâs no surprise theyâre frustrated.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

It does not appear Abedin made âa regular practiceâ of doing so. Other officials said it was likely that most of the emails got onto the computer as a result of backups of her BlackBerry.</p> <p>As for that âclassified informationâ: None of the messages were marked as classified at the time they were sent, according to ProPublica. And 10 of the 12 emails that were subsequently deemed to contain classified information landed on Weinerâs computer through those BlackBerry backups â not via forwarded emails, the FBI admitted Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>These are rather important distinctions.

Conversely, many on the Right are saying that the event should not be politicized until all information has been acquired and the dust has settled.","<p>The NRA is âthe countryâs most active and successful terrorist organization,â according to Death And Taxes Mag.</p> <p>Thatâs right. Not ISIS, Antifa, or any other radicalized group that spews hatred on the reg. Rather, itâs the NRA that stands to protect our Second Amendment rights.</p> <p>Death and Taxes writes:</p> <p>The NRA likes it when Americans are killed by gun violence. It needs it. Like any terrorist organization, the success of the NRAâs entire model is predicated on dead civilians â the more innocent, the better. When people are afraid, the NRA grows more powerful. There is only one way that the NRA is different than ISIS: The NRA is winning.</p> <p>To call this statement ignorant is a compliment. This is beyond insensitive. This is maniacal and hateful. Itâs purposefully inflammatory and intended to further skewer victims of gun violence and their families.</p> <p>Our grief isnât enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again. â Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017</p> <p>How about we ban machine guns? â Andy Cohen (@Andy) October 2, 2017</p> <p>Since it seems thereâs been a miseducation of the Hollywood and the elites, letâs review the facts.</p> <p>Since 1934, legally owned automatic weapons have been used in only three gun crimes. Fully automatic weapons have been illegal to manufacture for civilian use since 1986, and those made before the cut off date are astronomically expensive and almost impossible to purchase. Of the 91 mass shootings committed in America since 1982, not one has been carried out using a fully automatic weapon. Kind of nullifies the whole stricter-gun-laws debate.</p> <p>And since Hillary brought up the whole silencer/suppressor debate, letâs review the facts.</p> <p>A silencer wasnât used in todayâs Las Vegas attack. And contrary to popular belief, silencers donât really silence a weapon. They still make a sound reminiscent of a jackhammer. Additionally, .003% of suppressors are used in crimes each year.</p> <p>This isnât opinion. These are the facts. The bottom line is that itâs really hard and highly expensive to be a legal gun owner in the US. No matter how seemingly lenient state gun laws may be, federal law still trumps state law. Stricter gun laws might dilute the Second Amendment and make it harder for law abiding citizens to own a firearm, but I would be remiss if I failed to mention that criminals donât follow laws. Thatâs what makes them criminals.</p> <p>Besides, the Founding Fathers were pretty clear in their ideas about firearm possession. Take Thomas Jefferson, circa 1775:</p> <p>The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimesâ¦. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.</p> <p>The Second Amendment isnât about arming every gun crazed citizen in the U.S. Itâs about having the fundamental right as an American to own and protect his/her own property.</p> <p>So keep calling the NRA a terrorist organization that likes to see Americans killed. Keep likening it to ISIS and saying it needs red American blood on its hands. Youâre only further advancing the terroristsâ interests and making honest, law abiding gun owners angrier.</p> <p>WATCH SANDERS DISCUSS GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION WITH REPORTERS:</p> <p>WATCH THE LIBERAL MEDIA POLITICIZE THE WORST SHOOTING IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY:</p>",Right,Right,Right,Right

Cuomo, the three-time governor of New York and a leading voice of the Democratic Party's liberal wing who turned down several invitations to seek the U.S. presidency, died on January 1 at his home in Manhattan. He was 82. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid</p> <p>Hillary Clintonâs State Department approved a series of deals that gave Russiaâs atomic energy agency control of one-fifth of the uranium produced in the U.S. as major stakeholders in the transaction donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>The New York Times published the bombshell expose Wednesday night. The article advances on information contained in Peter Schweizerâs highly-anticipated book, âClinton Cash.â The book, set to be released May 5, has generated major pushback from the Clinton camp which claims that it is conservative propaganda.</p> <p>The uranium deal begins with Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining tycoon, who has pledged $100 million to the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>Giustra formed a company in the mid-2000s called UrAsia Energy which sought mining rights in Kazakhstan. Giustra obtained those rights after a fortuitous Sept. 6, 2005, meeting with Kazakhstanâs authoritarian president Nursultan Nazarbayev. Bill Clinton flew with Giustra on his private jet to the Central Asian nation, and sat in on that hours-long talk.</p> <p>Following that meeting, Clinton went on public television to praise Nazarbayev, who has been accused of rigging elections and other human rights violations. Days after this appearance, which The Timesâ reporter, Jo Becker, characterizes in her article as a propaganda ploy, the Kazakh government signed off on a deal that granted Giustraâs UrAsia access to its mines.</p> <p>After this, Giustra gave Clintonâs foundation a $31 million donation. Giustra also pledged to donate another $100 million to the charity. Giustra has denied that any money was given to the Clinton charity in exchange for help with business. He has said that his work with Clinton is centered on humanitarian and philanthropic efforts.</p> <p>In 2007, UrAsia merged with a South African company called Uranium One in a $3.5 billion deal. Uranium Oneâs chairman was Ian Tefler, a longtime business partner of Giustraâs who donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation between 2009 and 2012. Giustra said he sold his stake in Uranium One in 2007.</p> <p>Adding to the suspicious nature of Teflerâs donation, which passed through a private foundation set up in Canada, the Fernwood Foundation, is that the Clinton Foundation did not include it on its donors list. Hillary Clinton promised to release the full donor list when she agreed to serve as secretary of state in the Obama White House.</p> <p>That omission provides more fodder for critics who have accused the Clintons of being overly secretive regarding their charityâs operations.</p> <p>Two series of transactions involving uranium mining unfolded at around the same time which eventually ceded control of 20 percent of the uranium produced in the U.S. to the Russians.</p> <p>Uranium One was gobbling up uranium plays throughout the western U.S. while Russiaâs Rosatom was seeking to ramp up its investment in Uranium One. That effectively served as a backdoor for Russia to gain access to American uranium.</p> <p>In June 2009, Uranium One leaned on the American Embassy in Kazakhstan to approve a deal that would allow a subsidiary of Rosatom, ARMZ, to purchase a 17 percent stake of the company.</p> <p>Rosatom, through ARMZ, pushed for a larger stake the next year. It offered Uranium One shareholders a deal which would allow it to control 51 percent of the company.</p> <p>As Rosatomâs offer for the majority stake in Uranium One was still up in the air, Bill Clinton profited personally by giving a speech in Moscow which was paid for by a Russian investment bank, Renaissance Capital. Renaissance Capital also happened to be a major promoter of Uranium One stock, The Times reported.</p> <p>Four members of Congress and Wyoming U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, wrote President Obama condemning the proposed deal. Barrasso said it was âalarmingâ that Russia wanted to gain access to domestic uranium. Uranium One shareholders were also concerned that Rosatom was a âRussian state agent,â according to The Times.</p> <p>Despite those concerns, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a panel made up of members of the various U.S. cabinets, approved the deal.</p> <p>The Times was unable to report if Clinton herself weighed in on the decision to approve the transaction. However, Clinton has been described as a micromanager of State Department decisions.</p> <p>The majority stake in Uranium One gave Russia control of one-fifth of the uranium produced in the U.S., The Times notes. The concern about that control is not over the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but, rather, control of a major source of nuclear energy production.</p> <p>WATCH:</p> <p>Follow Chuck on Twitter</p>",Center,Right,Right,Right
f5bdcc87-eea0-4006-9860-f21d4241ff57,Everything Trump Does Must Be Viewed Through This Single Lens,"Anthony Scaramucci, President Trump's new director of communications, calls out ""Senior Leakers"" in the White House.","<p>Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p> <p>Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today: Trumpâs attacks on his attorney general, the Senateâs health-care vote, and new messaging from the Democrats.</p> <p>New White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci pledged to âfire everybodyâ to stop leaks to the press and almost immediately threatened Reince Priebus, implicitly accusing him of a felony. Meanwhile, the rift between Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggests Sessions may be out before long. What does Trump hope to gain from the purges in the highest reaches of his administration?</p> <p>At this juncture the priorities of Donald Trump have winnowed down to a single agenda item: saving himself and his family from legal culpability for their campaign interactions with the Russians and their efforts to cover up those transactions ever since. Almost everything this president does must be viewed through this single lens. If you do so, youâll find his actions usually make sense.</p> <p>This overriding motive explains both this weekâs orchestrated staff turmoil in the White House and the simultaneous assaults on the civil rights of transgender American troops and all LBGTQ employees in the private workplace. The primary purpose of all of it is to distract from investigations into potential Trump-family criminality and to galvanize a base that Trump believes will protect him against the rule of law. If you have already forgotten Jared Kushnerâs loophole-strewn profession of innocence from Monday, thatâs the point.</p> <p>It would seem particularly counterintuitive for Trump to go after the like-minded Sessions, who was not only the first sitting senator to endorse his campaign but whose Department of Justice has just filed the court papers seeking to cripple federal civil-rights law to roll back protections for employees based on sexual orientation. Sessions also shares Trumpâs xenophobic opposition to immigration and his antediluvian approach to criminal justice. Whatâs more, Sessionâs political allies are Trumpâs allies â from conservative Republican senators like Richard Shelby and Orrin Hatch to media cheerleaders like Breitbart and Tucker Carlson. But all of that is negated by Trumpâs sole priority of derailing the Russian investigation. Trump assumed that Sessions would fix the investigation on his behalf, much as he expected corruptible local officials to fix his legal violations as a real-estate developer, and was appalled that Sessionsâs recusal made that impossible. If Sessions survives, it will be only because Trump finds an easier way to achieve his No. 1 goal, the firing of Robert Mueller. Thatâs bound to happen no matter who stands in the way.</p> <p>Scaramucciâs inevitable humiliation will be entertaining to watch.</p> <p>As for Scaramucci, he may profess to know and love Trump, but clearly he doesnât understand him. If he did, heâd know that his days are already as numbered as Sean Spicerâs were. Trump is a diva who doesnât like anyone else to share his spotlight, and Scaramucci is a drama queen who seems determined to pull focus from his boss at any opportunity. He just canât help himself. Scaramucci wasnât even supposed to start officially as White House director of communications until August 15 and already he is overexposed. His inevitable sadomasochistic humiliation at the hands of the man he âlovesâ will be nothing if not entertaining to watch.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the departures and purges, this White Houseâs Nights of the Short Knives, will continue. The secretaries of Defense and State, Jim Mattis and Rex Tillerson, often considered the adults in the cabinet, are now castrated, serving as at best bystanders to major policy decisions. (Mattis, typically, was given only one dayâs notice about the transgender troop ban.) The only Trump appointees whose jobs are safe are Ivanka and Jared. Trump is in the bunker now. The president no doubt feels that he could pull out a gun and shoot his attorney general on Fifth Avenue, and his base would still remain loyal. I have no doubt heâs correct: This is the same quarter of the populace that believes it makes sense to endanger themselves by replacing Obamacare with a wish and a prayer â the same crowd that believes transgender patriots serving their country in uniform, not Russians who hacked our election, are a clear and present danger to American security.</p> <p>Following his dramatic return to the Senate after brain surgery in Arizona, John McCain delivered a fiery lecture about the âobligation to work collectivelyâ and voted to move the Obamacare repeal process forward. Will the rest of the health-care debate be worth the trip?</p> <p>If, as seems likely, the farcical GOP attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare ends in tragedy for millions of Americans deprived of health care, McCainâs trip to Washington will be a sad endnote to his career. With the notable exception of Donald Trump, most Americans deeply admire McCainâs courage as a prisoner of war and wish him a victory in his tough battle against cancer. Few can disagree with his speech this week chastising our bankrupt and inert Congress. But his actual vote in the Senate â to bail out Trump and Mitch McConnell in their desperate last-ditch bid to steamroll a cruel bill â directly contradicted his rhetorical sentiments that the Senate address health care through âregular orderâ in an open, bipartisan process instead of âbehind closed doors.â McCainâs heroism in Vietnam exemplifies the maxim that actions speak louder than words. His vote this week in Washington belied his words, and were all too typical of his historic failure to stand up to Trump forcefully in the two years since he ridiculed McCainâs wartime service. That capitulation to the crazies on the right is not a recent aberration: It was, after all, his cynical choice to put Sarah Palin potentially within a heartbeat of the presidency almost a decade ago that prepared the ground for Trump.</p> <p>Only 25 percent of Americans support the Republican health-care bill â whatever it is â according to a poll aggregation by the MIT political scientist Chris Warshaw. That 25 percent â i.e., the hard-core Trump base â includes many of the Americans most likely to be victimized by it. They will ignore the âfake newsâ telling them so and believe the president when he blames Obama and the Democrats for their medical indignities. But few others will buy Trumpâs passing of that buck. The GOP has owned American health care from the moment Trump held that premature Rose Garden âMission Accomplishedâ celebration of the passage of the House bill. The GOP will also own whatever comes next: the Senateâs âskinny repealâ or whatever bastard legislation may emerge from a compromise between House and Senate Republicans in conference. While it will be of little solace to those Americans who lose their insurance or find their premiums and deductibles skyrocketing, the price to be paid by Republicans on the ballot in 2018 will be commensurately catastrophic.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Democratic leaders rolled out their âA Better Dealâ agenda, an early effort to rebrand the party for 2018. What have they learned from the failures of last November?</p> <p>Little, if anything. One of the biggest lessons that the Democrats should have learned from Trumpâs victories over bland GOP opponents like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio as well as Hillary Clinton is that his off-the-rails fulminations, however offensive or dishonest, have rendered typically anodyne political âmessagingâ (the word itself is offensive) obsolete. The boilerplate cobbled together by consultants, focus groups, and party committees sounds like the cautious pandering it is. One can only imagine the high-level discussion that went into the too-clever-by-half rubric âA Better Deal,â which is as much a surrender to Trumpâs âArt of the Dealâ jargon as a jab at it and which sounds like a dime-store New Deal besides.</p> <p>The boilerplate cobbled together by consultants, focus groups, and party committees sounds like the cautious pandering it is.</p> <p>Reading Chuck Schumerâs explanation of what this deal is in his Times op-ed, one can see the game immediately: The âBetter Dealâ Democrats arenât going to offer an encyclopedia of planks as Hillary did (there are only three); they are not going to bring up gender or social issues or name-check minorities in the Democratic coalition (as Hillary did); and they are going to sound some populist notes (as Bernie Sanders and Trump did). But itâs populism lite: Thereâs nothing in this âBetter Dealâ to suggest that Democratic Establishment leaders like Schumer are going to abandon the corporate and Wall Street elites who have defined the partyâs economic profile since Bill Clinton turned the Treasury Department over to Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers â the cadre that most recently could be found paying Hillary Clinton those self-immolating speaking fees.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi was honest when she said âA Better Dealâ was not intended as âa course correctionâ but âa presentation correction.â Yet even that isnât entirely the case: Though Schumer describes the Democratsâ manifesto as offering âbold changesâ and âa new vision for our party,â much of its overall tone and substance is same-old, overlapping with what Schumer proposed in the book he published before the 2008 campaign, Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time.</p> <p>The recent Washington PostâABC News poll finding that only 37 percent of Americans think that the Democratic Party âstands for somethingâ â or, at best, âjust stands against Trumpâ (52 percent) â rings true to me. The Democrats will inevitably rebound after Trumpâs implosion as they did after Richard Nixonâs, but, as was the case in the short-lived Jimmy Carter interregnum of the 1970s, the partyâs comeback will prove short-lived if there is not a blood transfusion of new leaders and genuinely âboldâ ideas.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left
f785bd35-1ef6-477b-9821-b2684d111dcd,Paul Ryan Misleads With GM Plant Closure Tale,Ryan RNC Speech,"<p>TAMPA, Fla. -- In his prime-time speech at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday evening, vice presidential hopeful Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) illustrated economic failure under President Barack Obama with an anecdote about a factory that closed before Obama took office.</p> <p>Ryan said, ""Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said, 'I believe that if our government is there to support you â¦ this plant will be here for another hundred years.' Thatâs what he said in 2008.""</p> <p>""Well, as it turned out, that plant didn't last another year,"" Ryan continued. ""It is locked up and empty to this day. And thatâs how it is in so many towns today, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight.""</p> <p>It's an attack Ryan has used before, and one that the Detroit News has called inaccurate: ""In fact, Obama made no such promise and the plant halted production in December 2008, when President George W. Bush was in office,"" Detroit News reporter David Sherpardson wrote earlier this month. ""Obama did speak at the plant in February 2008, and suggested that a government partnership with automakers could keep the plant open, but made no promises as Ryan suggested.""</p> <p>Senior Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod pounced on the claim in a tweet: ""Again, Ryan blames Obama for a GM plant that closed under Bush. But then, they did say they wouldn't ""let fact checkers get in the way.""</p> <p>On Monday, Romney pollster Neil Newhouse, defending the campaign's blatantly false ads claiming President Obama removed work requirements from welfare, said, ""We're not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.""</p> <p>UPDATE: 8/30 -- For more on the closure process, which was announced in mid-2008, see the local Gazette Xtra. More than 2,000 Janesville GM workers were laid off immediately; another 57 stayed on until April 2009 as production wound down.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

(Caveat: Iâve never seen Sophieâs Choice; I assume itâs a movie about a bungling kidnapper who has to choose what ransom she should demand.) One option was the Keystone XL pipeline. The other was the risk corridor provision in Obamacare, which they falsely call a âbailout.â</p> <p>Hereâs what happened next. First, the Congressional Budget Office released its annual budget report, and, among other things, it utterly annihilated the premise that there is any such thing as an âObamacare bailout.â Having seen their imaginary claim conclusively debunked, Republicans are now leaning toward demanding its repeal anyway:</p> <p>Breaking: GOP leadership just met... they've decided to move forward with risk corridors as top debt-limit option, will explore viability â Robert Costa (@costareports) February 4, 2014</p> <p>The Obamacare Bailout repeal plan is âgathering momentumâ this morning. Tomorrow, the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee is holding a hearing entitled, âObamacare: Why the Need for an Insurance Company Bailout?â</p> <p>The alleged bailout is actually one of three provisions in the Affordable Care Act designed to prevent insurance companies from cherry-picking healthy customers. One of them, called ârisk corridors,â would impose a kind of tax on insurance companies that sign up healthier-than-expected customers, and reimburse the firms that sign up sicker-than-expected customers. (The same thing exists in the prescription-drug benefit enacted by Republicans in 2003 â the only difference is that Obamacareâs version of risk corridors only last for the first three years, while the Medicare Part D version lasts forever.)</p> <p>The Republican Party has decided that this amounts to a bailout, and has been pounding away at the theme for weeks, with major figures like Marco Rubio and Charles Krauthammer leading the way, and pretty much everybody else in the party following along.</p> <p>One obvious rejoinder to the charge is that bailout is not just a term of opprobrium you can hurl at any government program you donât like. As Mike Konczal has explained, bailouts are a specific kind of government intervention â âthese actions are special rules that go into effect only when a firm is already about to fail, and the moves are decided on a case-by-case situation (that is, bailouts are ex post and ad hoc).â If any government subsidy that prevents financial distress were a bailout, then roads would be a bailout for the auto industry and Social Security would be a bailout for bad investors.</p> <p>The bailout lingo is popular, of course, because the bailout of Wall Street, even if necessary, created justifiable animosity that conservatives are eager to transfer to other, non-bailout government programs. The distinction between bailouts and subsidies âstrikes me as a semantic quibble,â argues Reasonâs Peter Suderman, because risk corridors have been âtransformed from the revenue-neutral risk sharing program that was originally envisioned into a mechanism for the federal government to pay off insurers.â Likewise, Ramesh Ponnuru asserts, âthe exchanges as a whole will be unbalanced and in need of a taxpayer bailout.â</p> <p>Photo: Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images</p> <p>Note that theyâre both assuming not only that any subsidy can be fairly called a bailout, but also that a subsidy will surely exist. The risk corridor program could end up paying more than it takes in, in which case it will wind up subsidizing insurers. Conservatives have assumed as a simple given that the risk corridors will pay out more than they take in.</p> <p>Todayâs CBO report predicts just the opposite: that insurance companies will be paid $8 billion, but will pay back $16 billion. The risk corridor program is therefore predicted to result in a net expenditure of negative $8 billion. Repealing risk corridors would increase the projected deficit. If we accept the spurious equation of a subsidy with a bailout, then the Republican plan to repeal risk corridors would be a bailout, and the risk corridors would be the opposite of a bailout.</p> <p>Conservatives have assumed that of course risk corridors will pay out more to insurers, because of course the exchanges in Obamacare are failing to attract healthy customers and must be propped up. The quietest news in the CBO forecast is that thereâs no evidence this is happening. Yes, the bungled health-care launch lost two months of valuable outreach time, and implanted plenty of skepticism about the new law among consumers who knew little about it beside the failed website. Right-wing intellectuals spent last fall arguing not whether Obamacare was collapsing, but whether the entire liberal project was collapsing. (Yuval Levin last November: âit looks as though we may be witnessing a failure of the administrative state on a level unimagined even by its staunchest critics.â) Only a couple weeks ago, I futilely attempted to rebut two conservatives claiming the law was already âbeyond repair.â</p> <p>Todayâs report projects that the bungled launch will mean enrollment in the exchanges will collapse all the way from seven million people to â¦ six million people. Now, the number of people in the plan isnât the only or best measure of its success, but it is a measure critics have seized upon. The existence of the nefarious Obamacare Bailout was a second reason â as the House Republican hearing asks, why the need for a bailout, if not to save a doomed law? Thereâs no reason why the lack of an Obamacare bailout should prevent conservatives from feeling anger at it anyway.</p>",Left,Left,Left,Left

Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming..victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.""</p> <p>The presidentâs tweets came only a few weeks after Defense Secretary James Mattis said he would give military chiefs another six months to conduct a review to determine if allowing transgender individuals to enlist in the armed services will affect the âreadiness or lethalityâ of the force. The deadline for that review was Dec. 1, 2017.</p> <p>âThis is worse than donât ask donât tell, this is donât serve, donât serve,â The National Center for Transgender Equality said in a written statement. âThis is an appalling attack on our service members; it is about bigotry rather than military readiness, reason or science. It is indefensible and cannot stand.â</p> <p>The Family Research Council praised Trumpâs action.</p> <p>âI applaud President Trump for keeping his promise to return to military priorities â and not continue the social experimentation of the Obama era that has crippled our nationâs military,â FRC President Tony Perkins said in a statement. âThe military can now focus its efforts on preparing to fight and win wars rather than being used to advance the Obama social agenda.â</p> <p>Rep.

A RAND study found that there are between 2,500 and 7,000 transgender service members in the active-duty military, and another 1,500 to 4,000 in the reserves.</p> <p>The study also found that allowing transgender people to serve in the military would have a ""minimal impact"" on the health care costs.</p> <p>The Pentagon announced it would âcontinue to work closely with the White House to address the new guidance provided by the commander in chief on transgender individuals serving in the military.â</p> <p>âWe will provide revised guidance to the Department in the near future,â Pentagon spokesman Capt.

fbb01fcd-42d4-44ea-a243-86d3568389d3,Michael Flynn Guilty Plea & Mainstream Media,"Michael Flynn will reportedly testify against President Trump, saying that the then-candidate ordered him to make contact with the Russians during the election. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and is facing up to 5 years in prison.","<p>Michael Flynn arrives at a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., December 1, 2017. (Reuters photo: Jonathan Ernst)</p> <p>Thereâs less to the news than meets the eye.</p> <p>Former Trump-administration national-security adviser Michael Flynn is expected to plead guilty today to lying to the FBI regarding his conversations with Russiaâs ambassador to the United States.</p> <p>Flynn, who is reportedly cooperating with the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller, is pleading guilty in federal district court in Washington, D.C., to a one-count criminal information (which is filed by a prosecutor in cases when a defendant waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury).</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The false-statement charge, brought under Section 1001 of the federal penal code, stems from Flynnâs conversation on December 29, 2016, with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. At the time, Flynn was slated to become the national-security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump. The conversation occurred on the same day that then-president Barack Obama announced sanctions against Russia for its interference in the 2016 election. It is believed to have been recorded by the FBI because Kislyak, as an agent of a foreign power, was subject to monitoring under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).</p> <p>Mueller has charged Flynn with falsely telling FBI agents that he did not ask the ambassador âto refrain from escalating the situationâ in response to the sanctions. In being questioned by the agents on January 24, 2017, Flynn also lied when he claimed he could not recall a subsequent conversation with Kislyak, in which the ambassador told Flynn that the Putin regime had âchosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of [Flynnâs] request.â</p> <p>Furthermore, a week before the sanctions were imposed, Flynn had also spoken to Kislyak, asking the ambassador to delay or defeat a vote on a pending United Nations resolution. The criminal information charges that Flynn lied to the FBI by denying both that heâd made this request and that heâd spoken afterward with Kislyak about Russiaâs response to it.</p> <p>Thus, in all, four lies are specified in the one count. The potential sentence is zero to five yearsâ imprisonment. Assuming Flynn cooperates fully with Muellerâs investigators, there will be little, if any, jail time.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Obviously, it was wrong of Flynn to give the FBI false information; he could, after all, have simply refused to speak with the agents in the first place. That said, as I argued early this year, it remains unclear why the Obama Justice Department chose to investigate Flynn. There was nothing wrong with the incoming national-security adviserâs having meetings with foreign counterparts or discussing such matters as the sanctions in those meetings. Plus, if the FBI had FISA recordings of Flynnâs conversations with Kislyak, there was no need to ask Flynn what the conversations entailed.</p> <p>Flynn, an early backer of Donald Trump and a fierce critic of Obamaâs national-security policies, was generally despised by Obama administration officials. Hence, there has always been cynical suspicion that the decision to interview him was driven by the expectation that he would provide the FBI with an account inconsistent with the recorded conversation â i.e., that Flynn was being set up for prosecution on a process crime.</p> <p>While initial reporting is portraying Flynnâs guilty plea as a major breakthrough in Muellerâs investigation of potential Trump campaign collusion with the Russian regime, I suspect the opposite is true.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>While initial reporting is portraying Flynnâs guilty plea as a major breakthrough in Muellerâs investigation of potential Trump-campaign collusion with the Russian regime, I suspect the opposite is true.</p> <p>Speculation that Flynn is now cooperating in Muellerâs investigation stirred in recent days due to reports that Flynn had pulled out of a joint defense agreement (or âcommon interestâ arrangement) to share information with other subjects of the investigation. As an ethical matter, it is inappropriate for an attorney whose client is cooperating with the government (or having negotiations toward that end) to continue strategizing with, and having quasi-privileged communications with, other subjects of the investigation and their counsel.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Nevertheless, as I explained in connection with George Papadopoulos (who also pled guilty in Muellerâs investigation for lying to the FBI), when a prosecutor has a cooperator who was an accomplice in a major criminal scheme, the cooperator is made to plead guilty to the scheme. This is critical because it proves the existence of the scheme. In his guilty-plea allocution (the part of a plea proceeding in which the defendant admits what he did that makes him guilty), the accomplice explains the scheme and the actions taken by himself and his co-conspirators to carry it out. This goes a long way toward proving the case against all of the subjects of the investigation.</p> <p>That is not happening in Flynnâs situation. Instead, like Papadopoulos, he is being permitted to plead guilty to a mere process crime. A breaking report from ABC News indicates that Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians â initially to lay the groundwork for mutual efforts against ISIS in Syria. That, however, is exactly the sort of thing the incoming national-security adviser is supposed to do in a transition phase between administrations. If it were part of the basis for a âcollusionâ case arising out of Russiaâs election meddling, then Flynn would not be pleading guilty to a process crime â heâd be pleading guilty to an espionage conspiracy.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Understand: If Flynnâs conversations with the Russian ambassador had evinced the existence of a quid pro quo collusion arrangement â that the Trump administration would ease or eliminate sanctions on Russia as a payback for Russiaâs cyber-espionage against the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic party â it would have been completely appropriate, even urgently necessary, for the Obama Justice Department to investigate Flynn. But if that had happened, Mueller would not be permitting Flynn to settle the case with a single count of lying to FBI agents. Instead, we would be looking at a major conspiracy indictment, and Flynn would be made to plead to far more serious offenses if he wanted a deal â cooperation in exchange for sentencing leniency.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>To the contrary, for all the furor, we have a small-potatoes plea in Flynnâs case â just as we did in Papadopoulosâs case, despite extensive âcollusionâ evidence. Meanwhile, the only major case Mueller has brought, against former Trump-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an associate, has nothing to do with the 2016 election. It is becoming increasingly palpable that, whatever âcollusionâ means, there was no actionable, conspiratorial complicity by the Trump campaign in the Kremlinâs machinations.</p> <p>READ MORE:</p> <p>The Michael Flynn Charge: Monstrous Injustice or Prelude to Bigger Things?</p> <p>The Trump Collusion Case Is Not Getting the Clinton Emails Treatment</p> <p>The Manafort Indictment: Not Much There, and a Boon for Trump</p>",Center,Right,Right,Right

It was not about his discussions about lifting sanctions with Russia, which came after the warning. Ultimately though, it was those discussions and Flynnâs choice to lie about them to Vice-President Pence that led to his firing.</p> <p>Trumpâs tweet about Flynn precedes testimony this afternoon from Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general who warned the White House about Flynnâs discussions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.</p> <p>This isnât the first time the Trump administration has sought to blame Obama for the Flynn embarrassment. On April 28, Press Secretary Sean Spicer suggested that the Trump transitionâs failure to fully vet Flynn was the fault of the Obama administration because its officials gave him security clearance.</p> <p>The White House has yet to explain how Obama is to blame for Trumpâs hiring of Flynn.

President Trump tweeted about this report saying, ""the Al Frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words.â Some people have gone on to criticize Trump's tweet and the White House's response while others have argued that the focus should be on Franken, not on Trump.","<p>U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota was exposed on Thursday as a sexual predator, but it took some on the left a while to figure it out - and when they finally did, it served as an excuse to bring up alleged misconduct by President Trump.</p> <p>Franken was accused of sexual harassment from an incident 11 years ago that was captured in a damning photograph of him grabbing at the breasts of a sleeping woman. The victim, Los Angeles radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, also said that Franken shoved his tongue into her mouth during an unwelcome kiss on a USO tour in 2006.</p> <p>The photo is clear evidence of twisted behavior by Franken, but most mainstream media outlets softened the situation with terms that make it seem like the harassment is merely a rumor. The Associated Press published a story headlined, âFranken faces ethics probe after woman says he groped her,â and didnât embed the photographic evidence until more than 20 paragraphs into the story.</p> <p>The Washington Post published a story pointing out the way various media outlets covered the photo with words such as âallegedlyâ and ""says"" despite the undeniable evidence. Sexual harassment specialist and Ohio State University's Moritz College of Law professor Camille Hebert told the Post, âThese sort of qualifiers are incredibly frustratingâ¦ it seems to me that the media might be going beyond cautious and instead leaving the impression that we can't even believe women's claims of harassment and assault when our eyes and pictures provide proof that it happened.â</p> <p>MSNBCâs Kasie Hunt even downplayed the incident, referring to it as ânot actually groping, but mock groping.â CNN was a tad later than its competition to cover the Franken news, but once the network decided to cover it featured panel discussions where the actions of the former âSaturday Night Liveâ star were downplayed because he was âjust a comedianâ when the assault occurred.</p> <p>Others took to Twitter to defend Franken or point out the liberal bias in news coverage:</p> <p>Eventually, the mainstream media decided it was time to scrutinize Franken and hold him accountable. But they typically raised in the same breath the case of Roy Moore, the embattled Alabama Republican Senate candidate accused of inappropriate behavior with underage girls in the 1970s. When Trump chimed in on Twitter, it turned into a perfect opportunity for the anti-Trump crowd to bring up old allegations against the president.</p> <p>A panel discussion on CNN resulted in Trump criticizing Franken being referred to as an example of âhypocrisy and lack of moral leadershipâ from the president. Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News that the media âdesperatelyâ wants to move the story âaway from Franken and back to the right -- Roy Moore, President Trump or absolutely anyone else.â</p> <p>The New York Times published a story headlined, âTrump, a Veteran of Sexual Harassment Accusations, Scolds Franken.â Gainor said that when Trump took to Twitter to mock Franken on Thursday night, it âgave them the opportunity they wanted.â</p> <p>Check out some of the tweets that invoked Trump:</p>",Right,Right,Right,Right
