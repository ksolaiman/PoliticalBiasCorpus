These files contain source-level ideological labels (Left/Right) for curated documents, inferred from the publication outlet.
While not `*_900.csv` is not human-verified, they can serve as weak supervision for modeling or evaluation.
We also include the finer labels - `Lean Left/Lean Right`, and the final label - only `Left or Right`.
