These files contain source-level ideological labels (Left/Right) for curated documents, inferred from the publication outlet.
While not `*_900.csv` is not human-verified, they can serve as weak supervision for modeling or evaluation.
We also include the Finer-grained labels - `Lean Left/Lean Right/Center/Left/Right`, and the Final coarse label - only `Left or Right`.

<!-- Use these files for:
- Proxy bias alignment analysis
- Baseline labeling
- Cross-validation against human-annotated labels (see `gold/` folder) -->
