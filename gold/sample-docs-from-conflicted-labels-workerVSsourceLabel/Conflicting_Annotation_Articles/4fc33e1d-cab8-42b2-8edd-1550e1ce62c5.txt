Celebrities blasted President Donald Trump Monday after he called out the “KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups” following last weekend’s violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

“Modern Family” producer Danny Zucker slammed the president’s response condemning various hate groups as “too late” after riots broke out in the city during a white nationalist rally. (RELATED: Michael Moore, Other Celebs Blame Trump For Charlottesville Riots)

“I once challenged @RealDonaldTrump’s ratings & he tweeted me in 15 minutes. It took him 3 days to say the KKK is bad. Sorry, it’s too late,” Danny Zucker tweeted.

This is @realDonaldTrump‘s way of signaling to white supremacists that he didn’t mean any what he said today. https://t.co/1xqZVjDNjH — Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) August 14, 2017

I don’t want to hear one person say he’s “presidential”. Being presidential is not having to be *convinced* to condemn neo-Nazis and the KKK — Sarah Kendzior (@sarahkendzior) August 14, 2017

Try again TelePrompTer @realDonaldTrump. Tell the one about how when Mexico sends its people, “They’re rapists.” Judge Curiel’s listening. https://t.co/3YuzgZ0MdF — Jeffrey Wright (@jfreewright) August 14, 2017

For a guy who hates teleprompters, this jerk can’t even condemn racism without one. If I wasn’t so mad, I would laugh. — olivia wilde (@oliviawilde) August 14, 2017

It felt like @realDonaldTrump read the TelePrompTer message condemning hate groups like a hostage forced to read a statement by his captors. — Bryan Cranston (@BryanCranston) August 14, 2017

On Saturday, Trump tweeted that there’s no “place for this kind of violence in America.”

“We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one,” the president tweeted.
