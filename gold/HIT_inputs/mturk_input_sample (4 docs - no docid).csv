Ohio State Fake News Study Doesn’t Say What The Media Thinks It Says,The Washington Post’s Aaron Blake circulated a problematic study Tuesday that allegedly suggests fake news might have been the deciding factor for President Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 election.,Researchers at the Ohio State University concluded that “fake news most likely did have a substantial impact on the voting decisions of a strategically important set of voters — those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012.”,Follow Joe on Twitter.,"<p>The Washington Post’s Aaron Blake circulated a problematic study Tuesday that allegedly suggests fake news might have been the deciding factor for President Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 election.</p> <p>Researchers at the Ohio State University concluded that “fake news most likely did have a substantial impact on the voting decisions of a strategically important set of voters — those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012.”</p> <p>The study focuses on the voting behavior of 585 respondents from a sample of 1,600 who originally voted for former President Barack Obama in 2012 and then asked the group 281 questions “that included, in addition to the standard election-survey items, three fake news statements.”</p> <p>WATCH DAN RATHER ON FAKE NEWS:</p> <p>Such statements included “Hillary Clinton is in very poor health due to a serious illness,” which 12 percent of former Obama supporters said was “definitely true” or “probably true;” “Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump for president prior to the election,” which eight percent supported; and “During her time as U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton approved weapon sales to Islamic jihadists, including ISIS,” which 20 percent of Obama voters agreed with.</p> <p>From these numbers, the researchers extrapolated that the “pernicious pollution of our political discourse was sufficient to influence the outcome of what was a very close election.”</p> <p>Such a conclusion comes with a number of caveats. For starters, the researchers themselves acknowledge that “given the inability to determine temporal order in a single-wave cross-sectional survey, we cannot prove that belief in fake news ’caused’ these former Obama voters to defect from the Democratic candidate in 2016.” WaPo’s piece on the study is headlined “A new study suggests fake news might have won Donald Trump the 2016 election.”</p> <p>Moreover, the respondents agreed with fake statements after they voted. This carries the possibility they are simply justifying their 2016 choice.</p> <p>There is also no evidence that the fake statements or rumors used in the study were from foreign sources like Russia. Americans are perfectly capable of creating false stories on their own without outside interference.</p> <p>The researchers don’t have any evidence that these voters weren’t going to vote for Trump under any circumstances. It’s possible that many of these crossover voters felt better about their choice after learning Clinton had some sort of debilitating illness, but it’s unlikely that such a rumor would negate a voters’ policy preferences.</p> <p>A Stanford and New York University study concluded in 2017 that any so-called “fake news” stories likely had zero to minimal impact on the election’s outcome. The authors concluded:</p> <p>“If one fake news article were about as persuasive as one TV campaign ad, the fake news in our database would have changed vote shares by an amount on the order of hundredths of a percentage point. This is much smaller than Trump’s margin of victory in the pivotal states on which the outcome depended.”</p> <p>Follow Joe on Twitter.</p>","A new study suggests that fake news had a significant impact on the 2016 election, so much so that it may have given President Trump a pathway to win. The Left argued that the data shows a high probability that false stories cost Clinton the election, while the Right highlighted other studies that concluded fake news had little to no effect on the outcome."

revealed later Tuesday to Fox News that the plan considered by Trump would be a “substantial” mobilization of the National Guard</p> <p>“Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,” he said “That's a big step, we really haven’t done that before, or certainly not very much before”</p> <p>At a news conference later, he confirmed the plan, saying the border is unprotected by “our horrible, horrible and very unsafe laws”</p> <p>“We don't have laws, we have catch-and-release,” he said “You catch and then you immediately release and people come back years later for a court case, except they virtually never come back”</p> <p>Trump did not offer specifics, but the move appears to be at least partly motivated by a caravan of over 1,000 Central American migrants heading toward the US border Buzzfeed, which first reported on the caravan, said that Mexican officials had not yet attempted to stop the flow</p> <p>In Tuesday's discussion, Trump and senior officials “also agreed on the need to pressure Congress to urgently pass legislation to close legal loopholes exploited by criminal trafficking, narco-terrorist and smuggling organizations,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said She added that Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Joseph Dunford and Chief of Staff John Kelly were among the other officials present</p> <p>Reports of the caravan angered Trump, who has sent out a number of tweets threatening to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to cut foreign aid to countries such as Honduras, from w many of the migrants originate</p> <p>“The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border, had better be stopped before it gets t,” he tweeted Tuesday “Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen Congress MUST ACT NOW!”</p> <p>At the press conference he said that NAFTA was an “embarrasing” deal and that he had told Mexican officials on Monday: “I hope you're going to tell that caravan not to get up to the border” He added that he thinks the caravan was being broken up as a result</p> <p>The Pentagon was scrambling to come up with a response to Trump's statement on the military guarding the border But according to a memo obtained by Fox News and discussions with officials, one area w the Pentagon could contribute immediately is the Air Force’s Barry Goldwater live-fire range, which shares a 35-mile border with Mexico in southern Arizona</p> <p>The Defense Department is already offering some support to the border, including US Navy ships patrolling waters to seize drugs as well as missions involving over 100 personnel from US military’s northern command -- including eight planes and a drone -- to help border patrol</p> <p>In 2010, President Obama authorized 1,200 National Guard troops to increase security at the border, although Republican lawmakers questioned their role and whether they would in fact be “boots on the ground""</p> <p>Trump has struggled to secure funding for his central campaign promise of a wall, which the administration and border officials say will cost approximately $20-25 billion In the omnibus bill signed by Trump last month, $16 billion was included for technology and some replacement of existing border fencing -- although it excluded the prototypes Trump recently viewed in California</p> <p>Trump briefly considered vetoing the legislation both over its lack of funding for the wall and also the failure to include a fix for the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that granted protection for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children He has since floated the idea of getting the Pentagon to fund the wall</p> <p>Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, said on Fox News Radio’s “The Todd Starnes Show” that it gives Border Patrol “certainty of apprehension”</p> <p>“The criminal smugglers, this is a multibillion dollar industry They smuggle humans, they smuggle drugs,” he said “This criminal enterprise, if we arrest the majority of people that cross the border illegally, we put a dent into their criminal enterprise, and if you put a dent into their criminal
