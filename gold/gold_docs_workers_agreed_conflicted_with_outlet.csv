01dbbdbe-e1ed-4a8e-8f52-a1cc3a8765be,Donald Trump hits Russia with new sanctions for election meddling,"The U.S. will impose new economic sanctions on two-dozen Russian individuals and entities for cyberattacks in the U.S. and meddling in the 2016 election, senior national security officials said Thursday.","<p>The Trump administration slapped sanctions on two dozen Russian individuals and spy agencies Thursday, officially blaming them for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as the U.S. government joined its top European allies in blaming the Kremlin for a nerve gas assassination attempt on a former Russian spy in Britain this month.</p> <p>Among those targeted for the sanctions were 13 Russian nationals and three organizations already indicted in special counsel Robert Muellerâs investigation. They included Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch known as Russian President Vladimir Putinâs âchef.â</p> <p>The poisoning of the former Russian double agent and his daughter is the first chemical weapons attack in Europe since World War II, the U.S. and its allies said, accusing Moscow of violating international laws. The Kremlin has denied any role in the attack and vowed to retaliate after British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats, the biggest such move by the government since the end of the Cold War.</p> <p>But President Trump, acting on sanctioning powers granted by Congress months ago, was more muted in his criticism of the regime in Moscow and again avoided rebuking Mr. Putin personally.</p> <p>Asked if Mr. Putin was behind the nerve gas attack on Russian defector Sergei Skripal, Mr. Trump replied, âIt looks like it.â</p> <p>âA very sad situation â it certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,â Mr. Trump told reporters during an Oval Office event with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in advance of St. Patrickâs Day. âSomething that should never, ever happen. Weâre taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.â</p> <p>Mr. Trump didnât mention the sanctions or Russian meddling in the election, an issue that has been a sore point for the president since Democrats used it to try to question the legitimacy of his White House win. The presidentâs continued reluctance to call out Mr. Putin has raised eyebrows among Mr. Trumpâs political foes and allies in Washington.</p> <p>British officials have been far more blunt in criticizing Russia, even as the U.S., France and Germany signed on to a letter saying there was âno plausible alternative explanationâ to the nerve gas attack and calling it an assault on British sovereignty.</p> <p>The Russian government âshould go away and shut up,â British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson told reporters.</p> <p>Targeting the energy grid</p> <p>The Russians hit with U.S. sanctions were involved in election meddling and cyberattacks, including what Treasury Department and national security officials said were attacks on the U.S. energy grid, aviation system and infrastructure. It was the first time the administration fingered Russia for cyberattacks that began at least two years ago.</p> <p>Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said the sanctions were part of a âbroader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.â</p> <p>âThe administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyber activity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyber-attacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,â he said in a statement.</p> <p>Moscow vowed to retaliate.</p> <p>âWe have already started working on our reciprocal measures,â said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov. He didnât elaborate on what response to expect.</p> <p>Moscow has denied involvement in the poisoning, and Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied â including directly to Mr. Trump last year â that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.</p> <p>The sanctions target the Russian spy agency FSB and Russiaâs military intelligence agency GRU, as well as the Internet Research Agency, which Mr. Mueller has signaled was behind much of the cybermeddling in the presidential election.</p> <p>Treasury officials blamed the GRU and the Russian military for trying to interfere in the U.S. vote and for launching the âNotPetyaâ ransomware attack that wreaked havoc last year across the U.S., Europe and Asia.</p> <p>House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Edward R. Royce applauded the sanctions and said more needs to be done.</p> <p>âRussian cyberactors have been weaponizing information and targeting critical U.S. infrastructure undeterred for years,â said the California Republican. âAs our midterm elections approach, we must send a clear message that attacks on our political process will not be tolerated.â</p> <p>Democrats slammed the sanctions for being too little, too late.</p> <p>âOK, it took 14 months, multiple indictments, and a poisoning in Britain â¦ but â¦ finally. Now we must protect our elections going forward,â tweeted Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat.</p> <p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a driving force in accusations of Trump campaign collusion with Russia, called the sanctions a âgrievous disappointment.â</p> <p>He noted that only two more senior Russian officials were included and that the Obama administration had imposed sanctions in December 2016 on the others. He said it showed no new work by the Trump administration.</p> <p>âIt appears that Mr. Mueller is doing more to place consequences on Russiaâs behavior than the rest of the administration,â said Mr. Schiff.</p> <p>Friend or foe</p> <p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to clarify for reporters Thursday whether the White House considered Mr. Putinâs government a friend or an enemy.</p> <p>âRussia is going to have to make that determination,â she said. âTheyâre going to have to decide whether they want to be a good actor or a bad actor.â</p> <p>The Trump administration has punished Russia, including with sanctions, in response to its incursion into Ukraine and the forced closure of Russian outposts in San Francisco, New York and Washington.</p> <p>Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said that adding sanctions against the indicted Russians proved that Mr. Muellerâs investigation wasnât a âwitch hunt,â as the president claimed.</p> <p>âItâs more clear than ever that the president must not interfere with the special counselâs investigation in any way,â Mr. Schumer said.</p> <p>The strained relations between the West and Russia reached a breaking point with the March 4 assassination attempt, which left the former spy, his daughter and a British police officer hospitalized with serious medical problems. Britain identified the nerve agent used as Novichok, which the Soviet military developed in the 1970s.</p> <p>Novichok is difficult to detect and it is believed to be 10 times more potent than other nerve agents such as VX and sarin.</p> <p>Mr. Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Scribal, 33, were found collapsed on a city bench in Salisbury, England, suffering from exposure to Novichok on March 4.</p> <p>In 2004, Mr. Skripal was convicted by the Russian government of spying for MI6 and accused of revealing the names of Russian agents working in the West. He was released to the U.K. in a spy swap in 2010, becoming an outspoken critic of Mr. Putin.</p> <p>During a visit Thursday to the attack site, Mrs. May made it clear that she believed the Kremlin was behind the attack.</p> <p>âWe do hold Russia culpable for this brazen, brazen act and despicable act,â she said.</p>",Left,Right

061bce91-0472-4600-b6eb-ba06ccfbd32c,The Left Is Borrowing Hillary Hate From the Republican National Convention â With Dangerous Consequences,"The opening was unruly, with the firing of the DNC Chairman and unruly Sanders supporters. But the evening was all about unity.","<p>Photo: Jeff J Mitchell</p> <p>As the political focus moves from Cleveland to Philadelphia this week, there is hope among many Democrats that their convention can offer a positive, hopeful balm for last weekâs nasty, brutish gathering and its distressing reliance on violent rhetoric. But there is also fear that the heightened anger and antipathy toward Clinton, which last week included calls for her imprisonment and extrajudicial punishment, could be contagious. This is especially disturbing because of where that rhetoric inevitably led last week: to suggestions that someone should do the candidate physical harm.</p> <p>The most widely reported of these calls was made last week by Donald Trumpâs adviser, delegate, and New Hampshire state representative Al Baldasaro, who said in a radio interview that Clinton âshould be put on the firing line and shot for treason.â Baldasaro explained that he saw Clintonâs executable offenses as being linked to the right-wing furor over the Benghazi attack and Clintonâs email server: âShe is a disgrace for the lies that she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in Benghazi. She dropped the ball on over 400 emails requesting backup security.â</p> <p>This strain of fury was stoked by prime-time convention speakers including Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in the Benghazi raid. âFor all of this loss, for all of this grief, for all of the cynicism the tragedy in Benghazi has wrought upon America, I blame Hillary Clinton,â Smith said. âI blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son.â (Since then, the mother of Ambassador J. Christopher Stephens has publicly asked the Trump campaign to stop invoking her sonâs death in such an âopportunistic and cynicalâ way.)</p> <p>Baldasaro didnât back down, but later amplified his calls for Clintonâs death, noting in a follow-up interview with BuzzFeed that, âanyone that commits treason should be shot â¦ I believe Hillary committed treason.â This time, it seems, he was referring to the email scandal, claiming that âwhen people take confidential material off a server, youâre sharing information with the enemy. Thatâs treason.â</p> <p>Baldasaro was not alone in his calls for the death of the candidate whoâs about to be the first woman ever nominated by a major party for the presidency. Earlier in the week, Michael Folk, a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, had tweeted at Clinton, âYou should be tried for treason, murder and crimes against the U.S. Constitutionâ¦then hung on the Mall in Washington, D.C.â</p> <p>As several people on Twitter pointed out, this use of the language of treason, even without explicit calls for execution, is far from anodyne. Five thousand copies of a flyer depicting John F. Kennedy as âWanted for Treason,â and enumerating his sins, which included appointing anti-Christians to federal office and telling âfantastic LIES to the American people,â were distributed in Dallas, Texas, in the days before his 1963 assassination.</p> <p>The allegations of treason, lying, and criminality seem to offer moral cover to those who really, really hate Clinton, who hate her so much that their loathing can only be satisfied by fantasies about her violent and public demise. It allows her harshest critics to feel that their desire to hurt her stems from patriotism, perhaps to reassure themselves that their hate is not misogynistic but rather a commitment to moral, righteous justice.</p> <p>On Friday, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani gave a speech in which he reiterated the claim that Clinton is a âcriminal,â running not for office but to try to avoid âan orange jumpsuit,â and that if Donald Trump becomes president, he will âreopen the case.â Then, moving on to her electoral prospects, he felt comfortable using this language about her chances at the polls: âHillary, weâre going to kill you in upstate New York.â According to Politico, he raised his voice and added, âWeâre going to take you out in New York.â</p> <p>The language of physical harm is catching. When NPRâs âThe Takeawayâ reported from Cleveland bars last Thursday night after Trumpâs speech, they interviewed a GOP vice-chair who slurred, âWeâre building coalitions of the Asians, of the Orthodox Jews, Italians, Irish,â before growling, âWeâre gonna hurt her.â The âTakeawayâ hosts were briefly taken aback but then laughed off how much these jubilant, aggressive hordes had had to drink.</p> <p>All of this is why it is particularly alarming, as the Democratic convention kicks off in Philadelphia, to see protesters on the left voice their dismay with Clinton using the same âLock her up!â chants and signs that say, âHillary for Prison.â Itâs why itâs so disconcerting to hear Green Party candidate Jill Stein stoke those protesters convictions that Hillary is a lawbreaker by telling them, as she did on Sunday, that she will urge Bernie Sanders to withdraw his endorsement of Clinton âbased on the outright, purposeful sabotage of your campaign by the DNC and by Hillary Clinton.â</p> <p>The left certainly has its own longstanding, legitimate beefs with the candidate â about her vote to invade Iraq; her hawkishness; her position on Palestine; her relationship to banks; her support of her husbandâs 1990s legislation, including the crime bill and welfare reform; her tendency toward safe centrism, as seen in her decision to pick Tim Kaine as her running mate as opposed to Elizabeth Warren or Sherrod Brown. But none of these issues are whatâs being invoked when crowds of purported lefties shout about unproven crimes, fraud, rigging, sabotage, or when they cheer for Clintonâs imprisonment.</p> <p>Some progressives are eager to turn the hacked DNC emails into a scandal that proves malfeasance that thereby delegitimizes primary results, but it does no such thing. In fact, the email hack, as embarrassing as it might be, provides ample evidence that there was no rigging of the primary process by the DNC. There were a bunch of people who worked for the Democratic Party who hated Sanders, who hadnât been a member of the party for very long, and who was seriously challenging the party favorite. They didnât do anything about it. The one guy who suggested, horribly, that they attack Sanders on his lack of faith got shot down. It should now be abundantly clear that there was no systematic conspiracy to rob Sanders of the Democratic nomination. (And if there had been, it certainly could not have been pulled off by an organization that cannot tell its ass from its elbow. The only good news in all this is that Deborah Wasserman Schultz, who was not good at her job, is no longer in charge of the DNC.)</p> <p>When RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, tweets that âour election was stolen, riggedâ and that Wasserman Schultz was not âacting on her ownâ; when progressives cheer for WikiLeaks, which yesterday retweeted Ann Coulterâs racism and some anti-Semitism of its own; when Democrats are chanting âLock her up!â the language and objectives of left and right become increasingly indistinguishable.</p> <p>This isnât issues-based dismay over Hillary Clinton, and if it once were, it has transformed into something far more grotesque and dangerous. The merging of left-leaning political antagonism toward Hillary with the distortions of the right has left us here, with progressives â people who care deeply about our planet, about health care, about immigration, about minimum wage and police brutality and voting rights and reproductive rights and the future of the Supreme Court â heaping outsized condemnation not at the fascistic ogre who rose in Cleveland last week, but at the only person who realistically stands between him and his stewardship of this country. A vocal portion of the left is now aping the fantasy constructions of the right wing, showing themselves more focused on Hillaryâs personal destruction than on any of the crucial issues at stake in November. Welcome to the Democratic National Convention.</p>",Right,Left

Donald Trump has portrayed himself now consistently as fighting for the working people, and he has a record of sticking it to working people for 35 years.â</p> <p>âWeâre going to put a stop to it now,â Mr. Rubio said. âThere is no way we are going to allow a con artist to take over the conservative movement, and Donald Trump is a con artist.â</p> <p>Mr. Rubio had spent much of Thursday nightâs GOP debate attacking Mr. Trump, notably on his business record, and said without a sizable inheritance, the billionaire businessman would be selling watches in Manhattan.</p> <p>âThis is the most important government job on the planet, and weâre about to turn over the conservative movement to a person that has no ideas of any substance on the important issues, the nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual, and the conservative movement to someone who has spent a career sticking it to working people,â Mr. Rubio said on CBS.</p> <p>SEE ALSO: Trump on defensive in nasty GOP debate</p> <p>âI will acknowledge that there are some people watching this broadcast that are intrigued by him, that they think heâs a straight talker and he fights for the little guy, but Donald Trump has spent 40 years sticking it to the little guy, or longer, and every time one of those businesses of his failed, you know who didnât get paid?

162dd30f-423e-42b3-8ac4-73731bc4fa59,Surprise! Affirmative Action Just Won A Victory No One Expected In The Supreme Court,Court Tie Blocks Obama Immigration Plan,"<p>For the last several years, supporters of affirmative action have awoken every day justifiably fearing that the courts would bring race-conscious university admissions policies to a swift end. The 2006 appointment of Justice Samuel Alito gave conservatives a solid majority on the Supreme Court, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, the closest thing the Court has to a swing voter on issues of race, has not historically been sympathetic to affirmative action.</p> <p>Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, which the Supreme Court decided on Thursday, was the vehicle opponents of affirmative action chose in order to kill the programs. And, as this case proceeded through one of the most conservative federal appeals courts in the country and then, to two separate trips to the Supreme Court, it looked likely that affirmative action was on its death bed. Worse, for defenders of race-conscious programs, Justice Elena Kagan was recused from Fisher, so Justice Antonin Scaliaâs recent death appeared unlikely to change the outcome in this case.</p> <p>At yet, affirmative action will survive. As ThinkProgress quipped shortly after the second round of Supreme Court oral arguments in Fisher, Justice Kennedy spent the entirety of this litigation playing the role of the Dread Pirate Roberts from Rob Reinerâs classic film The Princess Bride. In that film, the Dread Pirate keeps a captive alive, telling him each night that âIâll most likely kill you in the morning.â Yet in the end, the pirate does not kill his captive, instead turning over his ship and his title to the new Dread Pirate.</p> <p>As it was in the movies, so it was Thursday in the Supreme Court â sort of. Though Kennedy appeared likely to kill affirmative action at many turns throughout this case, he cast the key fourth vote to uphold it over the dissents of his three most conservative colleagues. But, while Fisher is a victory for affirmative action, it is only a partial one. Kennedyâs opinion makes it clear that universities have a high and ongoing burden if they want to maintain affirmative action programs. It could also potentially inspire a rash of harassment suits targeting these programs.</p> <p>The University of Texasâ admissions system, as Kennedy notes, is unusual. About three-quarters of the class is admitted through a âTop Ten Percent Plan,â which admits all Texas high school students in the top ten percent (or, more recently, about the top eight percent) regardless of their other qualifications. This plan does admit some students of color, but it only achieved fairly marginal diversity. In 2002, for example, before the university implemented the affirmative action program that was challenged in Fisher, â52 percent of undergraduate classes with at least five students had no African-American students enrolled in them, and 27 percent had only one African-American student.â</p> <p>Then, in 2003, the Supreme Court upheld an affirmative action program at the University of Michigan law school in Grutter v. Bollinger. As Grutter held, and as Kennedy reiterates in Thursdayâs opinion, universities may consider race in admissions because racial diversity benefits all students. âEnrolling a diverse student body âpromotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables students to better understand persons of different races,ââ Kennedy explains. âEqually important, âstudent body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society.ââ</p> <p>In the wake of Grutter, Texas decided that race would be one of a myriad of factors that would play a minor role in determining who was admitted among the 25 percent of students who were not admitted by the Top Ten Percent plan. Kennedyâs opinion holds that Texas did not violate the Constitution when they decided to consider race in this way.</p> <p>So thatâs the good news for affirmative action. The bad news is that Kennedyâs opinion also imposes tough and continuing burdens on universities that wish to implement similar affirmative action programs. âBecause racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,â Kennedy explains, ârace may not be considered [by a university] unless the admissions process can withstandâ the highest level of constitutional scrutiny. In practice, that means that âthrough regular evaluation of data and consideration of student experience, the University must tailor its approach in light of changing circumstances, ensuring that race plays no greater role than is necessary to meet its compelling interest.â An admissions policy that survives review today may no longer pass Kennedyâs test tomorrow.</p> <p>Kennedy also emphasizes just how many hoops Texas jumped through in order to produce an acceptable plan. The University of Texas âconducted âmonths of study and deliberation, including retreats, interviews, [and] review of data.ââ This review culminated in a â39-page proposalâ that âwas written following a year-long study, which concluded that â[t]he use of race-neutral policies and programs ha[d] not been successfulâ in âprovid[ing] an educational setting that fosters cross-racial understanding, provid[ing] enlightened discussion and learning, [or] prepar[ing] students to function in an increasingly diverse workforce and society.ââ</p> <p>So, while other universities remain free to implement affirmative action programs after Fisher, they will need to jump through similar hoops. And even if they succeed in doing so, they still have an âongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies.â It is easy to imagine how conservative litigators can turn this obligation into an opportunity to harass universities with expensive suits designed to wear down the schoolâs commitment to affirmative action.</p> <p>In the meantime, however, affirmative action survives another day. Thatâs an outcome few people thought possible when Fisher first reached the Supreme Court.</p>",Right,Left

Mueller's staff apparently admits this egregious violation, which the law strictly forbids.</p> <p>Under the law, the only remedy is Mueller's dismissal from the case.</p> <p>The Records Are Private</p> <p>The Presidential Transition Act states that all records of transition operations are  and confidential.</p> <p>On November 16, 2016, roughly ten days after Trump was elected president, the Chief Records Officer of the U.S. Government sent a letter to all federal agencies reminding them that ""the materials that PTT members create or receive are not Federal or Presidential records, but are considered  materials.""</p> <p>Yet Mueller seems to have ignored the law. Without a warrant or subpoena, his team of lawyers brazenly demanded these  records from the General Services Administration (GSA) which held custody of the materials. The GSA does this as a service to all incoming presidents out of courtesy, but it neither owns the documents nor is authorized to release them to anyone under any circumstances because they are deemed entirely .</p> <p>If true, Mueller's conduct is not only unethical and improper, it constitutes lawlessness. On this basis, he must be removed and replaced.</p> <p>Counsel for the Trump Transition Team has sent a letter to Congress alleging the Fourth Amendment was violated in ""failing to obtain a warrant for the search or seizure of  property in which the owner has a reasonable expectation of privacy (Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 489).""</p> <p>Mueller might contest the claim of an unlawful seizure because the GSA  handed over the documents, but this disregards the fact that the GSA broke the law and Mueller surely knew it when he pressured the agency to do so.</p> <p>Privileged Material</p> <p>The most serious charge against Mueller is that he obtained, reviewed and used material that is .</p> <p>For months, Mueller allegedly failed to disclose to the transition team that he acquired these  documents. Under the law, he and his lawyers are not entitled to possess or read any of them. Even worse, the transition team says it warned the special counsel six months ago that it had no right to access the records without gaining permission from the PTT.</p> <p>Courts have clearly stated what prosecutors are supposed to do under these circumstances: ""An attorney who receives  documents has an ethical duty to cease review of the documents, notify the privilege holder, and return the documents."" (Arnold, 2004 U.S. Dist. Lexis 19381, at 30.)</p> <p>Did Mueller do this? Apparently not. He never notified PTT when his staff of lawyers encountered the  documents and he compounded his violation of the law by possessing and accessing them for months.</p> <p>Only the owner of such materials can waive the  that protects them. Since the GSA does not, under the law, own the records, only the transition team can make such a waiver. It did not.</p> <p>Hence, if any illegally obtained documents have been used in the Trump-Russia case, then the results are tainted and invalid. This is a well-established principle of law.</p> <p>Mueller Must Be Removed</p> <p>The use by Mueller of even one  document can, and must, result in his disqualification from the case.</p> <p>Courts have frequently used their supervisory authority to disqualify prosecutors for obtaining materials protected by the attorney-client privilege. (In re Grand Jury Proceedings John Doe #462, 757 F.2d600 Granger v Peyton, 379 F.2d 709, Arnold v. Cargill Inc., No. 01-2086, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19381.)</p> <p>Statutory law also demands Mueller's removal. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. 2635.501, government employees, including prosecutors, are directed to ""take appropriate steps to avoid an appearance of loss of impartiality in the performance of his or her official duties.""</p> <p>The lawyer for the Trump transition team states that the special counsel's office admitted in a telephone conversation on Friday that it failed to use an ""ethical wall"" or ""taint team"" to segregate any  records. This is often done to keep them isolated from lawyers and investigators involved in the case.</p> <p>Yet, Mueller did not adopt such precautionary measures. Instead, he apparently allowed his team to utilize the documents while questioning witnesses in the Trump-Russia case.</p> <p>If true, Mueller's conduct is not only unethical and improper, it constitutes lawlessness. On this basis, he must be removed and replaced.</p> <p>Given the insular nature of the special counsel operation, it is reasonable to conclude that all the lawyers and investigators likely accessed the  documents. Therefore, not just Mueller, but his entire team must be dismissed. This would include Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who oversees the case.</p> <p>Either Congress should take aggressive action or the Presidential Transition Team (now Trump for America, Inc.) must petition a federal judge to order their removal.</p> <p>The integrity of the special counsel probe has been deeply compromised by numerous allegations of corrupt acts. In its current composition, it seems beyond repair.</p> <p>The original version of this column incorrectly cited a case called ""Taylor."" The correct case name is ""Arnold.""

1d5c739f-5e4b-4be8-8a42-13d8a62eca40,IRS Targeted Tea Party Tax-Exempt Groups For Increased Scrutiny And Missed The Real Problem,IRS Apologizes,"<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) acknowledged Friday that it had improperly flagged groups applying for tax-exempt status for additional scrutiny if they contained common Tea Party keywords in their names. Rather than addressing the real problem of political committees masquerading as 501(c)(4) groups to evade public disclosure laws, this approach instead delayed the process for several groups purely on the basis of their names.</p> <p>Lois Lerner, head of the IRS unit that oversees tax-exempt groups, noted that the number of 501(c)(4) group applications doubled between 2010 and 2012. As a result of this influx, she explained, low-level workers at the agencyâs Cincinnati office had flagged about 300 applications for additional review based on a keyword search. None had their status revoked or denied and the IRS apologized for the mistake.</p> <p>While it unclear whether the IRS workers intentionally targeted conservative groups â an agency spokesman did not immediately respond to a ThinkProgress request for the complete list of keywords used â the office revealed that two of the terms on the list were âTea Partyâ and âpatriot.â As such, about 75 Tea Party groups were singled out for additional scrutiny.</p> <p>The spike in 501(c)(4) groups comes after the Supreme Courtâs 2010 Citizens United v. FEC decision that outside groups may make unlimited political expenditures. Since then, some 501(c)(4) organizations have begun abusing the system. Though groups engaged in some political activity may qualify as âsocial welfare groupsâ and receive tax-exempt status under this section of the tax code, electioneering cannot be their predominant activity.</p> <p>Karl Roveâs Crossroads GPS, for example, told the IRS that any political ads run by the group would be âlimited in amountâ and âwould not constitute the groupâs primary purpose.â Campaign finance reform advocates have argued that, in light of more than $70 million in âindependent expenditureâ ad spending, the groupâs primary purpose is clearly campaign activity. But rather than register with the Federal Election Commission as a political committee, Crossroads GPS continues to claim that it is not such a group and need not publicly identify its funders.</p>",Right,Left

""We have a crisis in employment among young people right now, and generation 18 to 30, people that got out of college, are finding there are no jobs for them. The last thing we want to do is have even fewer jobs for younger people.""</p> <p>But the president is reviving the issue as he tries to focus again on the economy.

As a result, the order would benefit far fewer workers than the number foreseen by advocates of federal contract employees.</p> <p>House Speaker John Boehner downplayed the impact the latest executive order would have. ""Let's understand something: this affects not one current contract, it only affects future contracts with the federal government.

And it has been done with support from Republicans and not just Democrats in the past,â Carney said.</p> <p>Obama, in an effort to avoid the appearance of being a lame duck president, is expected to use Tuesday's State of the Union address to make clear his intentions to use his executive powers to achieve his goals when Congress fails to pass legislation.</p> <p>Minimum wage is a perennial issue that has taken on a higher profile amid the slowly recovering economy and growing public debate about income inequality. A Quinnipiac University poll this month found 71 percent of Americans in favor of raising the minimum wage â including more than half of Republicans polled.</p> <p>Five states passed minimum wage measures last year, and advocates hope that number will grow as states from New Hampshire to Washington consider proposals. Many would push families above the federal poverty line, which is $15,730 for a family of two. In Iowa, a bill would hike the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10.</p> <p>Democrats across the political spectrum have lobbied for a higher minimum wage this year, after Obama got the ball rolling on the issue by calling for an increase in his February budget speech.

Bernstein</p> <p>The modern political convention is supposed to be an infomercial, one in which all intra-party tensions have been airbrushed away. But the Democrats find themselves at risk of throwing a convention that does the exact opposite â projecting an image of a party far more wracked by internecine conflict than it actually is.</p> <p>On Monday night in Philadelphia, Bernie Sanders will address the Democratic National Convention in prime time. Over the past 72 hours, the stakes of that address have increased significantly. At the end of last week, WikiLeaks published emails between staffers at the Democratic National Committee, which made vivid and explicit what had previously been opaque but assumed â the DNC did not want Bernie Sanders to win the Democratic primary, and put its thumb gently on the scales (to a degree that had no significant influence on the primaryâs ultimate result).</p> <p>Then a new batch of polls showed Donald Trumpâs festival of pseudo-fascism last week played exceedingly well among white, blue-collar voters â so well that, in a CNN/ORC poll, he now leads Clinton by five points. In that poll, 25 percent of Sanders supporters pledge their allegiance to either Green Party candidate Jill Stein or Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, when presented with those choices.</p> <p>The emails development â combined with Clintonâs selection of moderate Virginia senator Tim Kaine as her running mate â has injected new energy into Sandersâs most die-hard supporters, the ones who hope to (somehow) nominate the Vermont senator this week, or at least to ruin Clintonâs infomercial. The party has tried, unsuccessfully, to placate this faction, by bringing Florida congressperson (and Sanders nemesis) Debbie Wasserman Schultzâs tenure at the Democratic National Comittee to an untimely end.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the tightening polls suggest that, contrary to the conventional wisdom of a month ago, Clinton is going to need every last anti-Trump vote she can get this November.</p> <p>Crowd of Bernie delegates chanting ""We are the 1900,"" ""no fracked gas,"" ""bankers go to jail"" and a few other things near a meeting room â Kate Aronoff (@KateAronoff) July 25, 2016</p> <p>The dress rehearsal for that speech suggests these two goals may be mutually exclusive.</p> <p>âImmediately, right now, we have got to defeat Donald Trump,â Sanders said to hundreds of his delegates on Monday afternoon. â And we have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.â</p> <p>The delegates enjoyed the first half of this message.

We want Bernie!â</p> <p>The socialist senator made clear that his invocation of the âreal worldâ was not intended to discourage the crowdâs broader aspirations for radical change. Rather, Sanders argued that the tactic that was his presidential campaign has run its course. Now the movement must focus on keeping a dangerous demagogue out of the White House, while building strength on the local level.</p> <p>âReal politics is not necessarily sexy,â Sanders said. âYou have heard me say a million times that this campaign is not just about electing a president, as important as that is â¦ It is building a movement to transform this country. Election Days come and go, but the fight for social, economic, racial, and environmental justice continues.â</p> <p>Itâs not clear whether this message will pacify the most committed Sandernistas within the senatorâs delegation. Even if it doesnât, their numbers might not be large enough to make their presence felt inside a Wells Fargo Center packed with Clinton-backers and more placid Sanders fans.

As Philip Bump of the Washington Post notes, the Democratic Party is more unified than it appears</p> <p>Pew Research has been polling on the 2016 campaign for months, allowing it to track attitudes among voters over time. Nearly half of the Democratic electorate, 44 percent, changed their preference over the course of the three surveys Pew conducted. About 3 in 10 supported Clinton, wire-to-wire; about 20 percent Sanders. Pew asked those consistent Sanders supporters whom they support in the general election.

If, like me, you didnât see that coming, you have to admit it makes sense from a stylistic and geographic perspective. Boisterous is probably the euphemism for the rhetorical qualities the two share, along with a Greater New York orientation. And it is probably a relief for Christie, after heâs spent years sucking up to conservative activists, to join a campaign where itâs okay to admit the public sector has duties other than fighting wars and enforcing contracts. Christie will have to deal with hearing his own words mocking Trumpâs Muslim-immigration-ban idea quoted back to him; he will need, and is no doubt formulating, a quick response or just a brush-away reference to coalition politics.</p> <p>But itâs clear Christie and his new candidate of choice wonât have any trouble staying in harmony on the subject of the day: Marco Rubio as a stone loser, per the New York Timesâ Maggie Haberman:</p> <p>At Fridayâs news conference announcing the endorsement, which was peppered with demeaning insults of Mr. Rubio by the two men, Mr. Christie repeatedly attacked Mr. Rubio, calling his behavior at the debate âdesperateâ and reflective of a âlosing campaign â¦ â Mr. Trump heaped praise on Mr. Christie for tenderizing Mr. Rubio during the final debate in New Hampshire, where the Florida senator wilted under blistering criticism from the governor. âI thought he was gonna die â good going, Chris,â Mr. Trump said.</p> <p>Nothing like some Marco-bashing to bond two guys together, eh? But Haberman thinks Christieâs move will have more practical benefits than just messing with Rubioâs head:</p> <p>Mr. Christieâs endorsement augments Mr. Trumpâs appeal for working-class voters. But more significantly, Mr. Christie could become a catalyst for other leading Republicans to back him after they have held back from supporting the developer despite his recent string of victories.</p> <p>Weâll see. Iâd say Chris Christieâs endorsement plus 11 or 12 wins on March 1 would be a good one-two combo for Trump. And then, yes, Christieâs example could make it easier for other moderate or âsomewhat conservativeâ pols to gamble their respectability on a front-row seat at that most improbable of events: the nomination of Donald J. Trump.</p>",Right,Left

The top-ranking congressional Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan, said Thursday he doesnât see a purpose in recusal unless Sessions is the subject of the investigation.</p> <p>He told reporters heâs seen âno evidenceâ of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, and âDemocrats are lighting their hair on fire to get you to cover this story.â</p> <p>A White House official, in a statement, described Democratsâ demands as a âpartisanâ attack, suggesting the controversy is timed to distract from the positive response to President Trumpâs address to Congress earlier this week.</p> <p>âThis is the latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats. [Attorney General] Sessions met with the ambassador in an official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is entirely consistent with his testimony,â the official said.</p> <p>In a statement to Fox News, the former Alabama Republican senator said, ""I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.""</p> <p>While Sessions is denying he specifically discussed campaign issues with the Russians, The Washington Post first reported that he did speak twice last year with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. One discussion, in July, was described as involving a group of ambassadors after a Heritage Foundation event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention. Kislyak was part of a âsmall groupâ of diplomats who approached Sessions and spoke with him.</p> <p>A subsequent meeting was held in September in the senatorâs office. Justice officials said Sessions met with ambassadors in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p> <p>But while Sessions was serving on the Senate Armed Services panel, he also was a prominent surrogate for then-candidate Donald Trump. And in Senate testimony, Sessions denied contacts with the Russians.</p> <p>Asked by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., at that hearing what heâd do with evidence that anyone tied to the campaign communicated with Russia last year, Sessions said: âI'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I â¦ did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.â</p> <p>The Post noted that Sessions also responded, âNo,â in a written answer when asked whether heâd been in contact with any part of the Russian government regarding the election.</p> <p>Officials told the Post Sessions did not consider his discussions relevant and did not recall details of what was discussed with the ambassador from Russia.</p> <p>White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, speaking with âFox & Friendsââ Abby Huntsman, also said Sessions âdid his jobâ as a senator. He said Sessions was â100 percent straight with the committeeâ and Democrats are playing politics.</p> <p>âThere was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,â Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. âLast year, the senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors. He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign -- not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.â</p> <p>According to a schedule provided to Fox News, Sessions had 30 meetings with numerous ambassadors from April 14 through Nov. 11. Russia appears on the schedule only once â the Sept. 8 meeting with Kislyak. The day before, Sessions also took a meeting with Ukraine Ambassador Valeriy Chaly. These meetings took place a week before a seven-day unilateral ceasefire plan was accepted by Russia on behalf of separatist rebels it backed in the conflict with Ukraine.</p> <p>But for Democrats, the revelations of any Russia discussions only served to fuel long-running accusations that Trump-tied officials have sought to conceal past contacts with Moscow. Earlier this month, Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser amid accusations he misled Vice President Pence and others over his contact with the Russian ambassador.</p> <p>House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called Wednesday night for Sessionsâ resignation.</p> <p>âJeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate,â she said. âAttorney General Sessions has never had the credibility to oversee the FBI investigation of senior Trump officialsâ ties to the Russians. That is why Democrats have consistently called for Sessions to recuse himself from any oversight of the investigation. Now, after lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the attorney general must resign.â</p> <p>Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., also called for Sessionsâ resignation.</p> <p>All Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee wrote to FBI Director James Comey and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia urging a criminal probe.</p> <p>Others, including Franken, have called for Sessions at least to recuse himself from a DOJ Russia investigation.

The lawyers also sent a âcease and desistâ notice to Bannon, arguing that he violated a non-disclosure agreement signed during the campaign, by disclosing confidential information in speaking to the media about campaign and disparaging members of the Trump family.</p> <p>The president issued a multi-paragraph blistering takedown of âSloppy Steveâ Bannon, after the first excerpts of Wolffâs book were released, seeking to distance himself from his former chief strategist.</p> <p>TRUMP SLAMS BANNON AFTER CRITICISM, SAYING EX-CHIEF STRATEGIST 'LOST HIS MIND'</p> <p>âSteve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,â Trump said in the statement. âWhen he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.â</p> <p>When he left the White House, Bannon said he would work to help Trump and wage a populist campaign from the outside.</p> <p>âIf thereâs any confusion out there, let me clear it up: Iâm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents -- on Capitol Hill, in the media and in corporate America,â Bannon said in August upon leaving his post.</p> <p>Later this week, other Trump campaign officials, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former campaign spokeswoman now-White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, will testify before the same committee as part of its probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.</p> <p>Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.</p>",Left,Right

Anthony Weinerâs sexting â in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election.</p> <p>""[FBI Director James Comey] himself has said he doesnât know whether the emails ... are significant or not,"" Clinton told reporters in Iowa Friday evening. ""Iâm confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July. Therefore itâs imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay.""</p> <p>Earlier Friday, Comey informed top members of Congress in a letter that the bureau had âlearned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.â</p> <p>CLICK HERE TO READ THE LETTER</p> <p>Comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced âin connection with an unrelated case.â</p> <p>An FBI source, though, confirmed to Fox News that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced ex-Rep. Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. The New York Times first reported on the Weiner investigation connection, noting the FBI had been probing texts Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl.</p> <p>As Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seized on the FBIâs decision, interim Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile simply tweeted, âGood grief,â after the news of the Anthony Weiner connection broke. The Clinton campaign called the decision to revisit the case so close to the election âextraordinary,â and urged Comey to provide more details.</p> <p>Comey gave only a brief overview in his letter to lawmakers of what prompted their decision. He wrote that the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, âand I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.â</p> <p>He said the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete âthis additional work.â</p> <p>1,000 CLINTON-PETRAEUS EMAILS MISSING FROM RECORDS SENT TO STATE, FBI FILES SHOW</p> <p>FBI, DOJ ROILED BY DECISION TO LET CLINTON SLIDE, SAY SOURCES</p> <p>The move comes after Comey and the Justice Department decided in July not to pursue charges over Clinton's email practices, saying at the time that the investigation was finished.</p> <p>Comey later came under criticism from Trump, GOP lawmakers and others who claim the investigation downplayed the mishandling of classified information during Clinton's tenure.</p> <p>Trump, speaking to cheering supporters Friday afternoon in Manchester, N.H., praised the FBI for having the âcourageâ to âright the horrible mistake that they madeâ â saying he hopes that is âcorrected.â</p> <p>âHillary Clintonâs corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,â Trump said. âWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.â</p> <p>In a nod to the significance of the FBIâs announcement, Trump quipped: âThe rest of my speech is going to be so boring.â</p> <p>Other GOP lawmakers also weighed in, urging the bureau to pursue a thorough new probe.</p> <p>âThe FBIâs decision to reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton reinforces what the House Judiciary Committee has been saying for months: the more we learn about Secretary Clintonâs use of a private email server, the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in a statement.</p> <p>Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the discovery must be âseriousâ for the bureau to investigate this close to the election.</p> <p>Clinton did not respond to questions from reporters about the development as she landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and did not address the matter while speaking to supporters in the same city.</p> <p>But Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta sharply questioned the FBI's move and said Comey should ""immediately provide"" more information.</p> <p>""Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call. In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign,â he said in a statement.</p> <p>Podesta said âwe have no idea what those emails [that have come to light] are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.â</p> <p>According to a source connected to the Clinton campaign who spoke to law enforcement, the FBI has four devices â one belongs to Abedin, and at least one belongs to Weiner. So far, no classified information has been found on the devices, Fox News is told.</p> <p>The development comes 11 days before the general election, and is the latest shockwave to hit the race. Clinton had been gaining in the polls over Trump in the wake of the release of footage showing Trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him which he denies.</p> <p>However, daily revelations from hacked Clinton campaign emails obtained by WikiLeaks have become a headache for the Democrat's campaign. The resumption of the FBI probe poses a potentially bigger problem.</p> <p>Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI, told Fox News in a telephone interview that retired FBI officials were ""livid"" at Comey over the fact that charges were not brought against Clinton in round one of the investigation.</p> <p>""He lit her on fire and then walked away,"" Hosko said of Comey holding a news conference laying out Clinton's mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges.</p> <p>Hosko said he still defends Comey for not pressing charges because the FBI always has to make a decision ""based on what they have"" at the time.

785e479b-4cc4-4c56-9596-d3cf7cc5791f,Why The Racist And Homophobic âDuck Dynastyâ Comments Have Nothing To Do With Free Speech,Duck Dynasty Bigotry Controversy,"<p>CREDIT: @BoycottAETV</p> <p>On Wednesday, Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson made comments in a GQ interview condemning homosexuality as sinful and comparable to bestiality, as well as claiming that African Americans were better off under Jim Crow laws. A&E;, the network that airs the program, has since suspended Robertson from filming, prompting conservatives to rush to his defense. Even some prominent lawmakers are insisting that his free speech is in danger.</p> <p>Bobby Jindal (R), governor of Louisiana, which is where Duck Dynasty is filmed, argued that TV networks no longer believe in the First Amendment:</p> <p>Phil Robertson and his family are great citizens of the State of Louisiana. The politically correct crowd is tolerant of all viewpoints, except those they disagree with. I donât agree with quite a bit of stuff I read in magazine interviews or see on TV. In fact, come to think of it, I find a good bit of it offensive. But I also acknowledge that this is a free country and everyone is entitled to express their views. In fact, I remember when TV networks believed in the First Amendment. It is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended.</p> <p>Sen. David Vitter (R-LA), similarly claimed on Twitter that it was âwrongâ that Robertson is being âpenalizedâ for his faith. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) offered on Facebook that âfree speech mattersâ:</p> <p>If you believe in free speech or religious liberty, you should be deeply dismayed over the treatment of Phil Robertson. Phil expressed his personal views and his own religious faith; for that, he was suspended from his job. In a free society, anyone is free to disagree with him â but the mainstream media should not behave as the thought police censoring the views with which they disagree.</p> <p>Former half-term Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) was similarly worried about the fate of free speech:</p> <p>Free speech is an endangered species. Those âintolerantsâ hatinâ and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.</p> <p>In addition, a Facebook page called Stand with Phil Robertson now has over 700,000 âLikesâ â more than double what it had Thursday morning â and directs visitors to a âpetitionâ that collects information for the Tea Party-affiliated Patriot Action Network and urges A&E; to apologize to Robertson. The conservative group Faith Driven Consumer has its own petition asserting that Robertson was âdiscriminated againstâ and should be reinstated immediately. A Twitter profile called simply @BoycottAETV now has over 11,000 followers, producing memes with messages like, âFreedom of speech is not just for liberals!â Even Herman Cain thinks âthis crap is out of control.â</p> <p>These outraged messages have largely defended Robertsonâs anti-gay comments as an expression of his religious beliefs without acknowledging his remarks that African Americans were better off without full civil rights. On that point, they have been notably silent. Moreover, nothing about this situation has anything to do with âfree speech.â</p> <p>Robertson is a free man. He has not been arrested for his beliefs. He could continue to say whatever heâd like and, given the current media frenzy, it would probably be quickly published in many other places. Robertson could even take to his own website and publish whatever he wants to say, and individuals could share it through social media the world over. His freedom of speech has been in no way encumbered.</p> <p>A&E;, as a company, enjoys constitutional protections as well, and is under no obligation to provide a platform for messages it disagrees with. The networkâs statement suspending Robertson from filming was telling in this regard: âHis personal views in no way reflect those of A&E; Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.â A&E; is not Robertsonâs employer, lest it be forgotten that the show Duck Dynasty is about his actual business, Duck Commander, which produces duck calls and other related (and not-so-related) products.</p> <p>What actually is taking place is that conservatives are taking umbrage because a fellow conservativeâs beliefs are being publicly criticized. This happens all the time. When Chick-fil-A head Dan Cathy, whose company gives millions of dollars annually to anti-gay groups, said that homosexuality is âtwisted up kind of stuffâ that is âinviting Godâs judgment,â LGBT groups called for awareness-raising and boycotts while conservatives rushed to show their âappreciation.â The exact opposite happened when companies like Starbucks and General Mills announced their support for marriage equality: LGBT groups offered praise, while anti-gay groups vowed to dump their products.</p> <p>All of this is emblematic of free speech. Free speech allows citizens to say things that are offensive and unpopular and it allows other citizens to disagree, as well as to choose whether to provide an ongoing platform for those remarks. If anything, the claim that Robertsonâs free speech has somehow been inhibited is just a straw man to avoid addressing the merits of what he actually said: that all gay people are going to Hell and that African Americans donât deserve a seat at the lunch counter.</p>",Right,Left

One of my classmates â a distant cousin â didnât even get indoor plumbing until we got to middle school. This gives you an idea of the milieu.</p> <p>Today, I live in Northern Virginia. I take the Metro. I have a pet pug. Sometimes, I wear those nerdy glasses like the guy from Weezer. Iâm vaguely aware of âArcade Fireâsâ oeuvre. My wife shops at Whole Foods, which (depending on your point of view) makes me both patriarchal and a hipster.</p> <p>Iâm a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll.</p> <p>In this regard, I am perhaps the least likely person to care about the culture wars. In a way, I can identify with both sides. And yet, here I amâ¦</p> <p>Last night, I presented a binary choice between the red state âDuck Dynastyâ and the blue state âPajama Boy.â In truth, I suspect a lot of us are really somewhere in the middle (since when did loving âvaginaâ and sipping hot chocolate in some cozy jammies become mutually exclusive? Arenât these things like peas and carrots?)</p> <p>And since I personally couldnât care less if you are gay or a redneck (or a gay redneck!), I would love nothing more than to live in a society that is tolerant and (not to say the sexes arenât different) gender-blind, etc.</p> <p>But things are complicated by the fact that progressive activists and agitators arenât interested in comity or stasis or accommodation. Instead, they view division and conflict as necessary steps to achieve their progressive goals (which seem to be the dismantling of any traditional value or institution.)</p> <p>As RedStateâs Erick Erickson constantly reminds us: âYou Will Be Made to Care.â</p> <p>And so, if you own a flower shop and â because of your religious convictions â decline to work for a gay wedding, you will be made to care. If your five-year old son makes a âgun gestureâ with his hand, you will be made to care. If youâre a redneck in Louisiana who believes homosexuality is a sin, you will be made to care.</p> <p>At some point, this became a zero-sum game. Youâre either in the âDuck Dynastyâ camp or the âPajama Boyâ camp.

Just minutes after the incident, commentators sought to attribute the incident to the fact that Umpqua Community College was a âgun free zone.â</p> <p>âThe gun free zones are the areas that tell licensed gun owners that you are not allowed to carry your weapon in this facilityâ¦If youâre going to perpetrate some act, you know that most people are not going to be armed,â CNN âmilitary analystâ Rick Francona said a few minutes after the shooting.</p> <p>A retired Navy Seal, Jonathan Gilliam, also appearing on CNN, went even further. Blaming the âgun free zoneâ for the scope of the tragedy and adding âthe only thing thatâs going to stop a gun is another gun.â</p> <p>Umpqua Community College, however, was not a gun free zone. A 2011, state court decision prohibited public colleges from banning guns on campus. The decision stemmed from a suit filed by the Oregon Firearm Education Foundation, a gun rights group. There was an effort to pass a new law to reinstate the ability of public colleges to ban guns. That measure was defeated by gun rights advocates.</p> <p>Update:</p> <p>The conservative site Breitbart and others assert that guns were banned at UCC. This is not true. The student code of conduct bans guns âwithout written authorization.â Under Oregon law, the university could not ban people with a valid concealed carry license from bringing their weapons on campus. (They could ban gun from various buildings and facilities.) Conservative writer Dana Loesch, who initially claimed the campus was a âgun free zone,â updated her article to clarify that individuals with concealed carry permits were allowed to bring guns on campus.</p> <p>There was, in fact, someone on campus with a concealed carry weapon at the time of the massacre.

8e9c7ff4-d3bb-4cf5-8f4e-55cbc2344e7b,Did Hillary Back Foreign Deals Due to Clinton Foundation Donations?,Hillary and the Russian Uranium Deal,"<p>Photo: John Moore/2014 Getty Images</p> <p>Earlier this week, the New York Times teased the forthcoming book Clinton Cash, in which conservative author Peter Schweizer alleges that foreign entities made donations to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for favors from Hillary Clintonâs State Department. Several news outlets, including the Times, received early access to the book to fuel their own reporting on the subject, and Senator Rand Paul declared that the revelations would be âalarmingâ and âmind boggling.â</p> <p>The first round of those reports was published on Wednesday, and so far Paul was right â but not in the way he intended. Sifting through the connections between foreign CEOsâ business dealings, foundation donations that were only partially disclosed, speaking fees collected by Bill Clinton, and decisions made by the former secretary of State is certainly âmind boggling,â but so far thereâs no smoking gun.</p> <p>The biggest revelation so far concerns the sale of one of the United Statesâ largest uranium mines to Russiaâs state atomic energy agency, Rosatom. The Wyoming mine â which could produce as much as half of the U.S. uranium supply this year, according to The Wall Street Journal â was formerly owned by the Canadian company Uranium One, but from 2009 to 2013 the Russians took control of the company. Because the $610 million sale could have national security implications for the U.S., it had to be approved by a federal committee composed of several government agencies. Hereâs how the Clintons were involved: Hillaryâs State Department was one of the agencies that approved the deal in 2010, and the New York Times reports that during that time Uranium Oneâs chairman, Ian Telfer, made four donations to the Clinton Foundation via his family foundation, totaling $2.35 million. Despite the Clintonsâ agreement with the Obama administration, those donations were not disclosed.</p> <p>While that sounds fishy, so far thereâs no evidence that the donations affected the dealâs approval. In addition to the secretary of State, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) includes the attorney general and the secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy. Itâs also possible that the decision was made by deputies or assistant secretaries in those agencies, not the cabinet members themselves. The Clinton campaign provided a statement from a former assistant secretary of State who said Clinton ânever intervenedâ while he was handling CFIUS matters. Telfer said he made the donations to support his business partner, the Canadian mining executive Frank Giustra, and âthe donations started before there was any idea of this takeover.â</p> <p>Speaking of Giustra, Politico reports that heâs the subject of another tale from Clinton Cash. Giustra sits on the Clinton Foundationâs board, has pledged more than $100 million to the foundation, and cofounded the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership. The chapter âRainforest Richesâ reportedly details Giustraâs close relationship with Bill Clinton and notes that he benefited from the secretary of Stateâs support of a 2011 free trade agreement with Colombia.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said thatâs among the âmost laughableâ theories in the book, since Giustra donated to the foundation prior to 2008, but during the primary both she and Obama opposed the deal. âHer support for the deal came only after she joined the Obama administration, when key worker protections were added to the package,â Fallon said. âBy that point, the agreement was an administration-wide priority, and then-Secretary Clintonâs statements in support of the deal reflected the administrationâs position.â</p> <p>A source with âknowledge of the Clinton Foundationâs fund-raising operationâ confirmed the obvious to the Times: Many donors are giving to the Clinton Foundation because they hope the money will advance their cause. âWhy do you think they are doing it â because they love them?â the source quipped. But that doesnât necessarily mean that they were successful in their efforts to influence the Clintons. If the early reports are any indication, untangling the former (and possibly future) first coupleâs professional and charity work is going to be an arduous task for journalists, and the findings may test the limits of Americaâs interest in Clinton scandals.</p>",Right,Left

During her 20-minute speech, DeVos called the current campus reporting process a âfailed systemâ that is âincreasingly elaborate and confusing.â</p> <p>She did not announce any large policy changes to Title IX other than implying that the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter would be rescinded when she told the crowd âthe era of rule by letterâ has ended.</p> <p>The Obama-era Dear Colleague Letter, which was created by then-Vice President Joe Biden in 2011, is a comprehensive set of guidelines that essentially serve as a reminder to universities and Title IX administrators that schools need to follow the Title IX law.</p> <p>DeVos also announced two new approaches to the campus sexual violence reporting process that the Department of Education is exploring. The first is that the Department âwill launch a transparent notice and comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties,â including feedback from the public and educational institutions.</p> <p>âNo one benefits from a system that does not have the publicâs trust,â DeVos said, referring to the current Title IX system.</p> <p>No one benefits from a system that does not have the publicâs trust. Secretary Betsy DeVos on the current Title IX process</p> <p>The second approach DeVos announced on Thursday is that the department will implement a regional reporting center model. The model would allow universities and colleges to opt in to local reporting centers that would partner with state attorneys general and law enforcement to ensure the reporting process runs fairly.</p> <p>The Secretary of Education repeatedly discussed the rights of not only survivors of sexual assault, but also those who have been âwrongly accusedâ of sexual misconduct.</p> <p>She allotted most of her speech to anecdotes about how the current Title IX system has failed survivors and those wrongly accused.</p> <p>âOne rape is one too many, one assault is one too many, one aggressive act of harassment is one too many, one person denied due process is one too many,â DeVos told the crowd at George Mason. âThis conversation may be uncomfortable, but we must have it. It is our moral obligation to get it right.â</p> <p>Bloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump shakes hands with Betsy DeVos during a parent-teacher conference listening session inside the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017.</p> <p>Although just between 2 and 10 percent of reported rapes turn out to be false claims, DeVos devoted equal time to the stories of sexual assault survivors and those wrongly accused as if the group is the same size as survivors of sexual violence.</p> <p>âThis campus official, who may or may not have any training in adjudicating sexual misconduct, is expected to render a judgment,â DeVos said, walking the crowd through the Title IX process. âA judgment that changes the direction of both studentsâ lives. The right to appeal may or may not be available to either party and no one is permitted to talk about what went on behind closed doors. Itâs no wonder so many call these proceedings kangaroo courts.â</p> <p>Notably, the groups that most often refer to Title IX proceedings as âkangaroo courtsâ are Menâs Rights Activists and others who believe that the Title IX process is built to favor accusers over the accused.</p> <p>DeVosâ announcement doesnât come as a surprise to many advocacy groups who have had concerns about the Secretary of Educationâs views on Title IX since she was confirmed in February.</p> <p>There are no two sides when it comes to rape. Period. Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of UltraViolet</p> <p>Before the announcement, survivor advocacy groups including End Rape on Campus and Know Your IX, NARAL and the Feminist Majority Foundation rallied outside of the law school as a sign of protest. Many protestors tweeted their support of the advocacy groups using the hashtag #StopBetsy.</p> <p>âThere are no two sides when it comes to rape. Period,â NitaChaudhary, co-founder of feminist organization UltraViolet, said in a press statement after DeVosâ announcement. âWith sexual assaults routinely going unreported, un-investigated and unpunished, the scales are already heavily tipped in the favor of rapists. The idea that we need to focus more on the rights of the accused would be laughable if it werenât so terrifying and outright dangerous.â</p> <p>Anti-sexual violence organization KnowYourIX put out a similar statement after DeVosâ announcement:</p> <p>Today, Secretary DeVos sent the message to student and survivors across the country that the Department of Education doesnât have their back. Before the Education Department took action to protect survivors, and hold schools accountable, too many young people were forced to drop classes they shared with their rapists, take long leaves of absence, or even leave school entirely. The Departmentâs guidance, which outlined survivorsâ rights under longstanding federal law, was a response to this urgent reality. Todayâs announcement risks taking us back to to the days when sexual violence routinely compromised survivorsâ access to education and schools swept sexual assault under the rug.</p> <p>Alexandra Brodsky, a civil rights attorney and co-founder of KnowYourIX, told HuffPost earlier this week that rescinding the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter does not actually change the law.</p> <p>âThe [Title IX] law hasnât changed at all,â Brodsky told HuffPost. âSurvivors have the same rights, schools have the same responsibility.â The concern advocates have is that there will be less clarity for all parties involved in Title IX adjudication. âIt helps students understand what their rights are. But itâs not just survivors who are really going to struggle with this,âJess Davidson, Managing Director of End Rape on Campus told HuffPost. âThe people who use the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter the most â or are supposed to use it the most â are Title IX administrators, the people who are conducting these investigations on campuses across the country.â</p>",Right,Left

The indictment has been sealed by a federal judge, leaving many questions about who is involved and what the charges are.","<p>A federal grand jury has approved the first charges in special counsel Robert Muellerâs investigation into possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump presidential campaign, with indictments to be announced as early as Monday, according to multiple news agencies.</p> <p>The charges being filed was reported first by CNN, which said anyone charged will be taken into custody Monday. However, the charges have been sealed by a federal judge. So whoever is charged and whether the charges are criminal remains unclear.</p> <p>During a Saturday appearance on Fox News, former Department of Justice official Robert Driscoll told anchor Leland Vittert itâs possible the indictment might not even be directly tied to Russian collusion.</p> <p>âThink back to the Clinton years,â Driscoll said. âThe Whitewater investigation was about an Arkansas land deal. And it ended up being about something else completely.â</p> <p>Driscoll added, âRobert Mueller is free to look at taxes, is free to look at lobbying filings, foreign agent filings. Things like that could all be involved that wouldnât necessarily touch on the issue of Russia collusion that everyone seems focused on politically.â</p> <p>Speculation has focused on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as likely targets.</p> <p>Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago -- for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017.</p> <p>Federal agents, reportedly in search of evidence related to the Russia investigation, this summer raided his northern Virginia home. He also was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.</p> <p>Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired for failing to fully disclose his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, then-Russian ambassador to the United States.</p> <p>The FBI also secured approval from a federal court to monitor the communications of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.</p> <p>On Saturday, Page released a statement to Fox News in response to questions about whether he or his lawyers have been notified about any charges.</p> <p>Page said in the statement that he has worked with the executive branch and Congress since being contacted in March. But he also suggested that revelations about the Democratic Party having helped finance a dossier to smear Trump has tainted any Russia probe.</p> <p>âIn terms of âcharges', I canât even imagine what might even be considered now that the false evidence from the politically-motivated, big-money-financed Dodgy Dossier that started this extrajudicial disaster has instead been so thoroughly exposed as a complete sham,â Carter wrote in the statement.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported at least one person could be taken into custody as early as Monday.</p> <p>Richard Hibey, an attorney for Manafort, told Fox News on Friday that neither he nor any of his colleagues representing Manafort had been informed of any indictment of their client.</p> <p>Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago â for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017. In addition to his home being raided, Manafort was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.</p> <p>A retired Army lieutenant general, Flynn served as a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired over his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, who was Russia's ambassador to the United States.</p> <p>Mueller has reportedly probed whether Flynn was involved in a private effort to get former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers.</p> <p>NBC reported Saturday that Mueller will make public an indictment on Monday.</p> <p>The Justice Departmentâs special counselâs office declined to comment on the reports of filed charges.

Did he go too far?,"<p>New Hampshire Representative Al Baldasaro is a co-chair of the Trump campaign for veteransâ issues. He helped write Trumpâs veteransâ plan. He appeared as a surrogate for the Trump campaign around the country â including events in South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Delaware and New York. He served as a delegate for Trump at the Republican convention and was a member of the credentialing committee.</p> <p>Reached by phone in New Hampshire, Baldasaro told ThinkProgress that he believes Khizr Khan, the gold star father who criticized Trump at the Democratic convention, is an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood. Baldasaro explained that he believes Khan has âlong ties to the Clinton and Obama campaign.â That is damning because âin the White House there is the Muslim Brotherhood.â Baldasaro suggested âlooking it up on the internetâ for more information.</p> <p>There is no evidence that Khan had any connection to Clinton or Obama prior to agreeing to speak at the Democratic convention.</p> <p>Earlier today Baldasaro tweeted an article from a fringe anti-Islam conspiracy site, making similar claims.</p> <p>On the phone several hours later, Baldasaro maintained that the article could be accurate because one the authors, Walid Shoebat, âhas been on TV.â</p> <p>Still, after tweeting the article multiple times, Baldasaro began to have second thoughts because he didnât like what the article âsaid about the son.â The article suggested Humayun Khan, a recipient of the Bronze Star, was a double agent âworking for the US and Al-Qaedaâ¦ killed before his Islamist mission was accomplished.â (That language was recently deleted from the article.)</p> <p>Baldasaro tweeted that he is ânot sure about [Shoebatâs] credibility.â Still all of his earlier tweets â and his belief that Khan is an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood â remain.</p> <p>Indeed, Baldasaro expanded his critique of Khizr Khan. He said he was âsickenedâ and âdisgustedâ by Khan, accusing him of using his son as a political pawn.</p> <p>Khan famously implored Trump to read the Constitution, offering to lend his well-worn pocket edition. âMr. Khan needs to read the constitution about the duties of the President,â Baldasaro said, adding that his attacks on Trump were âhalf cocked.â</p> <p>Baldasaro said he had not been contacted by the Trump campaign concerning his tweets on Khan.</p> <p>Last month, Baldasaro called on Hillary Clinton to be executed by firing squad and refused to apologize. The Trump campaign issued a mild statement saying that they âdo not agreeâ with Baldasaro but was âincredibly grateful for his support.â Baldasaro told ThinkProgress that his role with the Trump campaign had not changed at all since the incident.</p> <p>Despite his title and extensive involvement with the Trump campaign, Baldasaro insisted that he was speaking only for himself.</p> <p>âI donât speak for Trump,â he said, âOnly Trump speaks for Trump.â</p>",Right,Left

Sessions did not mention either meeting during his confirmation hearings. A Justice official said Sessions didn't mislead senators during his confirmation, since he was asked about communication between Russia and the Trump campaign - not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.","<p>In November, then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) called for Loretta Lynch to recuse herself from any investigation into Hillary Clintonâs use of a private email server or improper conduct by the Clinton Foundation, saying the attorney general could not be impartial after her impromptu meeting with former President Bill Clinton on an airplane in Phoenix.</p> <p>âWhen a high public official is accused of serious wrongdoing and there is a sufficient factual predicate to investigate, it is imperative the investigation be thorough, with dispatch and without partisanship,â Sessions wrote in an op-ed, co-signed by other high-profile Donald Trump supporters.</p> <p>Sessions is now the attorney general. And he is so far resisting calls to recuse himself from any investigation into Russiaâs interference in the 2016 elections â even after The Washington Post reported that he met with Russiaâs ambassador to the U.S. twice during the campaign, and that he failed to disclose those encounters when asked about them under oath during his confirmation hearing.</p> <p>âIâm not aware of any of those activities,â Sessions said in January, when Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) asked him whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign had met with Russian officials.</p> <p>âI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians,â he added.</p> <p>Sessions has maintained that his conversations with the ambassador were part of his duties as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a Trump surrogate.</p> <p>But even with that explanation, his position has become far more precarious following the Postâs story. A growing number of Democrats and some Republicans have called on him to step aside from any investigation into Russiaâs role in the election and whether Trump associates or campaign aides had improper contact with Russian officials during that time.</p> <p>Some of these Democrats, it's worth noting, are themselves singing a different tune on impartiality now than they used to. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), for example, has called for Sessions to recuse himself, but previously defended Lynch's ability to handle the Clinton investigation after the airplane meetup.</p> <p>Still, Sessions' earlier call for Lynch to recuse herself makes it all the more difficult for him to argue now that he should remain in a managerial or oversight role in the investigations that the FBI, which reports up to the Justice Department, has launched into Russiaâs election interference.</p> <p>Indeed, during his confirmation hearing for the attorney general post, Sessions said that had he been in Lynchâs shoes at the time of the meeting with Bill Clinton, he would have stepped aside.</p> <p>âShe did not officially recuse. And there is a procedure for that, which I would follow,â he said, as noted by the Democratic opposition research group American Bridge. âI believe that would be the best approach for the country because we can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute. Thatâs not in any way that would suggest anything other than absolute objectivity. This country does not punish its political enemies, but this country ensures that no one is above the law.â</p>",Right,Left

b840383b-2266-48a1-bfef-91d652ec3f62,Donald Trumpâs Foreign Workers: American Workers Arenât Good Enough,Rubio Unleashes On Trump,"<p>Trump Tower in New York City (Spencer Platt/Getty)</p> <p>The news that Donald Trump turned down 94 percent of American job applicants to his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., in favor of foreign workers brought in under the H-2B visa program should come as a surprise to absolutely no one. Over the course of the campaign season, Trump has proven himself a liar of Clintonian proportions, and there has never been any reason to believe that he was somehow more trustworthy when it came to his rhetorical opposition to Americaâs foolish immigration policies â the ostensible raison dâÃªtre for his presidential campaign, one might recall. Moreover, the fact that he is more gold-obsessed than King Midas should have suggested otherwise.</p> <p>And, indeed, this turns out not to be the first time that Donald Trump has undermined American workers to expand his profit margin. That has been his M.O. throughout his career.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>In the early 1980s, Donald Trump was a thirtysomething real-estate up-and-comer embarking on what would, for a while, be the tallest all-glass structure in Manhattan, and what remains the centerpiece of the Trump architectural empire, his Vanity of Vanities: Trump Tower, on New York Cityâs Fifth Avenue. According to Barbara Res, the then-31-year-old who Trump selected to oversee Trump Towerâs construction, the Donald humbly referred to Trump Tower as âThe Most Important Project in the World.â</p> <p>Apparently, the first leg of the project was too important to entrust to American workers. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Federal Court, members of House Wreckers Local 95 alleged that, to avoid paying union employees their pension and welfare benefits, Trump (and the contractor he used for the job, Kaszycki & Sons) brought in some 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish the Bonwit Teller building that then occupied the site of the future Trump Tower.</p> <p>RELATED: What if Trump Doesnât Have Billions?</p> <p>Trump denied the claims, testifying that he only found out that undocumented workers were employed on the site long after the demolition. He demurred about even having visited the site. That turned out not to be true: âTestimony established that Donald Trump visited the 57th Street site and observed Kaszyckiâs Polish workers, noting that they were âgood hard workers,ââ the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York wrote in its opinion in 1991. âWorkers also observed Trump visiting the job site of the Bonwit Teller demolition job.â And itâs likely that he would have been able to distinguish between union and non-union workers: âThe Polish workers were obvious not only in numbers but also in appearance. In contrast to the union workers the non-union, Polish workers were distinguished by the fact that most of them did not wear hard hats. In addition the Polish workers staged several very visible work stoppages because they were not being paid their wages.â</p> <p>Trump-owned companies have tried to import 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000.</p> <p>There were other good reasons to disbelieve Trump. Daniel J. Sullivan, a labor consultant and FBI informant who had advised Trump on the demolition, testified that Trump told him about undocumented workers at the site. Meanwhile, Thomas Macari, a vice president of Trump-Equitable and its manager in charge of the demolition of the Bonwit Teller Building, was on the site regularly. According to the court opinion, Macari âwas involved in every aspect of the demolition job. He knew the Polish workers were working âoff the books,â that they were doing demolition work, that they were non-union, that they were paid substandard wages with no overtime pay, and that they were paid irregularly if at all.â And, as if that were not enough, Macari had interacted extensively with John Szabo, an immigration lawyer representing undocumented workers who were making claims for unpaid wages. In court, Szabo testified that a âJohn Barronâ of the Trump organization had called him in 1980 and threatened a $100 million lawsuit if Szabo did not drop the undocumented workersâ claims â and Trump admitted that he and another of his executives sometimes used âJohn Barronâ as an alias in business dealings. (As ex post facto confirmation of Szaboâs claim, consider that a) bullying inconvenient individuals is a go-to Trump tactic, and b) his son by his third wife, Melania, is âBarron William Trump.â)</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>RELATED: The Litigious â and Bullying â Mr. Trump</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The court ruled against Trump, finding that he and Kaszycki & Sons had âknowingly participatedâ in a scheme to get out of paying the union what it was owed. Trump won a partial victory on appeal, when the Second Circuit overturned part of the decision and referred the rest of it for âfurther proceedings.â But the available facts are hard to dispute.</p> <p>#share#Some three decades later, nothing has changed. Last year, the Washington Post reported that Trump is using undocumented workers in the construction work on his much-feted project to convert Washington, D.C.âs Old Post Office Pavilion into a luxury hotel. âInterviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally,â the Postâs Antonio Olivo wrote in July, âbefore they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.â</p> <p>Donald Trump is not looking out for American workers. He is looking out for his own pocketbook.</p> <p>Trumpâs executive vice president and legal counsel, Michael Cohen, âsaid the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.â (Ahem? â see above.) He then pointed the finger at the contractor Trump has employed: âMr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor. That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employeesâ status is accurate.â Of course, if history is any indication, just because Trump is employing a contractor does not mean he is unaware of the status of at least some of the workers.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Furthermore, itâs hard to imagine that Trump is utterly in the dark about his D.C. project. He apparently has spent days âbeat[ing] up some contractorsâ employed in the development, as he boasted on Kelly Ripaâs radio show in January of last year. And he told Pat Robertson, during a visit to Regent University earlier this week, that his daughter, Ivanka, is spearheading the project, with help from his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric (the executive vice president and executive vice president, developments and acquisitions, of the Trump Organization, respectively).</p> <p>#related#And, of course, there is Trumpâs use and abuse of Americaâs visa programs, beyond Mar-a-Lago. Reuters reviewed Department of Labor data last August, and reports that Trump-owned companies have tried to import 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000. Jobs âthat Americans wonât doâ include waitress, cook, vineyard worker, golf-course superintendent, hotel manager, banquet manager, and maid. Additionally, American women apparently are not attractive enough for Donald Trump; the Trump Model Management and Trump Management Group LLC have sought to import 250 fashion models from overseas.</p> <p>Conservative voters who believe that a President Trump will enforce and strengthen our immigration laws, will prosecute those who violate them, and will put the interest of American workers first are deluding themselves. Donald Trumpâs professional history is one of undermining American workers â by exploiting the law wherever possible and, when thatâs not enough, breaking it outright. Donald Trump is not looking out for American workers. He is looking out for his own pocketbook. Thatâs not going to change by putting him in the White House.</p>",Left,Right

""What happened [in Las Vegas] is, in many ways, a miracle. The police department, theyâve done such an incredible job. And weâll be talking about gun laws as time goes on.""</p> <p>It will nevertheless be difficult to avoid questions about gun control, as a majority of Americans support strengthening existing gun laws, USA Today reported. Senior Democratic politicians have also urged Trump to push for additional regulations.</p> <p>One of them, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., appealed to Trumpâs previous stance of supporting some gun control.</p> <p>âPresident Trump, before he ran for office, was for certain sane, rational, limited aspects of gun control,â Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday. âMaybe he can have a bit of a reawakening because of the horror of what happened as he goes to Las Vegas tomorrow.â</p> <p>Schumer said he also hoped to see a bipartisan effort to push against the âabsurd law about silencersâ -- referring to a bill that would lift a ban on devices that muffle the sound of gunfire. (After the Las Vegas shooting, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he has no plans to bring the silencer bill to the House floor for a vote, the Washington Post reported.)</p> <p>Trump responded saying, âWeâll talk about that later.â</p> <p>But despite taking a moderate position on gun control while a private citizen, President Trump has since become a staunch defender of the Second Amendment -- earning the endorsement of the National Rifle Association during the 2016 presidential election.</p> <p>âYou came through big for me, and I am going to come through for you,â Trump said in April at the NRAâs convention.</p>",Left,Right

Millions of Americans prefer the care they already have to that which the law purports to make affordable. Even the lawmakers who wrote it and the labor unions that spent liberally to help enact it are finding it a raw deal.</p> <p>Substantial parts of the law have been delayed and plenty of politically connected organizations and businesses have gotten waivers. Polls show that many Americans would like waivers or delays for themselves. This is true of independents and a significant minority of Democrats, not just Republicans. There is bipartisan support in Congress for repealing the medical devices tax and delaying the individual mandate.</p> <p>But you wouldnât know anything about this because at the precise moment Obamacare has begun to fall apart, when it is denounced as much at an AFL-CIO convention as a meeting of Tea Party Patriots, Republicans have opted to train their fire on one another.</p> <p>No one faction is entirely to blame. Capitol Hill is filled with Republicans who would rather complain about Ted Cruzâs table manners than do anything about Obamacare. Cruzâs supporters have elevated tactical differences into theological disputes.</p> <p>The party has spent months divided between an anti-Obamacare strategy that is unworkable and an anti-Obamacare strategy that is nonexistent.

The federal government currently piles up as much debt in a decade as it once took 200 years to amass. It took until 1987 for the federal budget to reach $1 trillion and until 1998 for the national debt to reach $5 trillion.

Many publications have noted that this likely means the bill is dead and will not move forward. McCain said in a statement that he, ""cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,"" as it had not gone through a bipartisan, rigorous debate process.","<p>Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</p> <p>Wall Street Journal writer Kimberley Strasselâs column typically channels talking points from congressional Republicans, and todayâs effort is dedicated to putting the squeeze on Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski. Strasselâs method of persuasion draws less on the theories of Hayek or Friedman and instead reflects the influence of the lesser-known conservative moral philosopher Vito Corleone.</p> <p>Strassel throws in a handful of substantive defenses of the Graham-Cassidy bill. She touts the âformula twiddles Senate Republicans are considering to ensure rural states arenât harmed by Medicaid block grantsâ â which is to say, the Republican plan will harm tens of millions of people but allegedly spare the denizens of Murkowskiâs state. But the heart of Strasselâs analysis is that Murkowski has a nice state here, and it would be a shame if something happened to it. If Murkowski does not accept the bribe, Strassel warns:</p> <p>She would get the fury of a White House and a GOP Congress with far more power over Alaska than just its health care. As Ms. Murkowski knows better than anyone, Alaska lives or dies on federal largess. It routinely tops the list of federal funding per capita. It receives billions in annual federal grants and billions more in defense spending. Federal money supports an estimated one-third of all the jobs and household income in the state.</p> <p>Some of these funds come from mandatory entitlement programs, but the money that really matters is discretionary. Itâs the Denali Commission. Itâs the Essential Air Service, which subsidizes flights in rural Alaska. Itâs grants for weatherization, and village water projects, and salmon recovery. Itâs wildlife refuge payments and bridges to nowhere. Itâs upgrades for military bases.</p> <p>Later in Strasselâs column comes the âIâm a lawyer, I have not threatened youâ passage:</p> <p>Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called Ms. Murkowski after her July health-care defection to let her know President Trump would be turning off the tap, and ending Alaskaâs enormous opportunity to cash in on energy deregulation. The liberal press howled over this supposed âthreat.â But why should the nation continue to send outsize taxpayer funds to a state that is single-handedly condemning Americans to ObamaCare?</p> <p>Consider the progression of thoughts here. In the first sentence of this paragraph, Strassel describes a Trump administration threat to exact policy retribution on a completely unrelated policy area if Murkowski opposed their bill. In the next sentence, she insists itâs not really a threat. (The word gets a set of scare quotes along with a supposed.) And then, in the next sentence, she contradicts the previous one by underscoring the threat and arguing that itâs justified. Why, asks Strassel, should the government upgrade military bases in Alaska if Murkowski is unwilling to sign a bill that she believes would hurt people?</p> <p>Threats only work if the target believes the person issuing them is completely unethical. Whatâs most telling about the congressional Republicansâ warning, issued via Strassel, is that it makes no distinction between legitimate and illegitimate spending. Presumably there could be some kind of neutral good-government test of spending programs that distinguishes between those with merit and those without. Strassel just tosses them all â military-base upgrades, which she presumably considers merited, and bridges to nowhere, which she presumably does not â into the same category.</p> <p>This threat would be worthless if Murkowski believed the congressional Republicans would evaluate spending programs that benefit Alaska on their merits. But that possibility is clearly so naive Strassel does not even bother to deny it. Strassel just straight-up operates from the assumption that of course completely unrelated programs will be either approved or canceled on the basis of political blackmail.</p>",Right,Left

e009eceb-8760-4619-96e3-ec962682ef8e,A Lot Of Media Outlets Botched The CBO's Obamacare Report,Obamacare and Jobs,"<p>""We got a report today about Obamacare that was both surprising and widely misunderstood,"" CBS anchor Scott Pelley said on his Tuesday show.</p> <p>Part of the reason for that misunderstanding? Many of Pelley's fellow members of the media.</p> <p>The Congressional Budget Office issued a report on Tuesday that said that as many as 2 million people could exit the workforce thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The reasons for this, the CBO said, were varied, but it stressed that the economy would see ""a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than...a net drop in businessesâ demand for labor,"" thanks to, for instance, people choosing to quit jobs they didn't like but were only staying in because of their health care benefits.</p> <p>That's not how a lot of media outlets reported the news, however. A lot of them said that the report was warning that Obamacare would kill over 2 million jobsâa notion at odd's with the CBO's conclusion that some workers would choose not to work.</p> <p>This led to a lot of alterations like the one the Washington Post had to make on Tuesday afternoon:</p> <p>CORRECTION: This tweet was wrong so we deleted it. CBO didn't say ACA would cut 2M jobs.

eb344d33-63dc-4df8-8909-0c9bcf8454ff,Obama: GOP trying to âplunge this country back into a recessionâ,GOP Fighting Obamacare,"<p>After a disagreeable phone call with Speaker John A. Boehner on the budget impasse, President Obama Saturday accused House Republicans of trying to âplunge this country back into a recessionâ in their battle with the president over Obamacare.</p> <p>In his weekly address, Mr. Obama blamed the gridlock on âa faction on the far right of the Republican party whoâve convinced their leadership to threaten a government shutdown if they canât shut off the Affordable Care Act.â</p> <p>âSome are actually willing to plunge America into default if they canât defund the Affordable Care Act,â Mr. Obama said. âThink about that. Theyâd actually plunge this country back into recession â all to deny the basic security of health care to millions of Americans.â</p> <p>The president called Mr. Boehner Friday night after the House approved a stopgap funding bill to keep government open while blocking all funding for Obamacare. An aide to Mr. Boehner said the call was âbriefâ and the two men disagreed about House Republicansâ intention to link an increase in the nationâs borrowing limit with other budget issues, including health care.</p> <p>âThe president called the speaker â¦ to tell him he wouldnât negotiate with him on the debt limit,â the Boehner aide said. âGiven the long history of using debt limit increases to achieve bipartisan deficit reduction and economic reforms, the speaker was disappointed but told the president that the two chambers of Congress will chart the path ahead.â</p> <p>The House vote set up a showdown next week with Senate Democrats and the administration over a possible government shutdown on Sept. 30, when funding for the current fiscal year expires.</p> <p>Mr. Obama said in the weekly address that he wonât allow the country to default on its obligations.</p> <p>âThatâs not happening. And they know itâs not happening,â he said of the GOP. âThe United States of America is not a deadbeat nation. We are a compassionate nation. We are the worldâs bedrock investment. And doing anything to threaten that is the height of irresponsibility. Thatâs why I will not negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States.â</p> <p>The president said Washington is ârunning out of time to fix this,â but said the solution is simple.</p> <p>âWe could fix it tomorrow,â Mr. Obama said. âBoth houses of Congress can take a simple vote to pay our bills on time, then work together to pass a budget on time.â</p>",Left,Right

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said âyes,â she believes the 2016 Democratic nomination for president was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton, and that the party faces âa real problemâ in dealing with the fallout from the revelation that Clintonâs campaign secretly took over control of the Democratic National Committee in 2015.</p> <p>Responding to the disclosure by Donna Brazile, who became interim chairwoman of the DNC as last yearâs election approached, Warren told CNNâs Jake Tapper on Thursday that Democratic leaders must restore faith in the partyâs operations.</p> <p>âWhat weâve got to do as Democrats now is hold this party accountable,â Warren said, adding that the current DNC chairman, former Labor Department Secretary Tom Perez is âbeing tested.â</p> <p>Do you agree with the notion that the DNC was rigged in Hillary Clinton's favor?</p> <p>Elizabeth Warren: Yes https://t.co/TIoytO15Ca pic.twitter.com/TjkBS0mbB8 â The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) November 2, 2017</p> <p>She said that when Perez won the party post early this year, âthe very first conversation I had with him [was] to say, you have got to put together a Democratic Party in which everybody can have confidence that the party is working for Democrats, rather than Democrats are working for the party.â</p> <p>Brazile wrote in her new book, Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House, that shortly after she took the DNC job in late July 2016, she discovered the Clinton campaign had signed an agreement to help keep the DNC financially alfoat, a deal in âwhich [Clinton] expected to wield control of its operations.â</p> <p>The agreement between the DNC and the Clinton camp was signed in August 2015, several months before the primary season began and almost a full year before she officially secured the nomination over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I).</p> <p>The Clinton campaign âhad the DNC on life support, giving it money every month to meet its basic expenses, while the campaign was using the party as a fund-raising clearing house,â Brazile said in her book, to be released on Tuesday.</p> <p>âThe funding arrangement ... was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical,â Brazile wrote.</p> <p>The excerpt, first published in Politico, includes details about Brazileâs call to Sanders after she discovered the arrangement, set up under her predecessor, Rep.

f7f48882-42c6-4c4f-8b34-6d6f0c442084,Lewandowski Claims Captain Khan Would Still Be Alive If Trump Had Been President,Donald Trump continues to be attacked by Gold Star families and some in the GOP for his comments to the father of a slain Muslim U.S. solider. Did he go too far?,"<p>Monday morning, former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski claimed on CNN that Captain Humayun Khan would still be alive if Donald Trump been president a dozen years ago.</p> <p>âWeâve had 7,000 soldiers who have died, $6 trillion wasted overseas that if Donald Trump was president, we would never have had, and Captain Khan would be alive today,â Lewandowski, who is now a paid CNN contributor, said.</p> <p>Khan, a Muslim U.S. Army Captain, was killed in Iraq in 2004 while heroically protecting his men from an attack on their compound. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star. Last week, his father, Khizr, delivered an emotional anti-Trump speech during the last night of the Democratic National Convention. Trump initially responded not by recognizing Humayunâs heroism or acknowledging the Khan familyâs loss, but by suggesting Khanâs wife Ghazala remained silent during her husbandâs DNC speech because her Muslim faith forbid her from speaking.</p> <p>Later during the CNN segment, Lewandowski explained that since Trump opposed the Iraq War, if he were president, the United States would not have invaded. Thus, not only would Captain Khan still be alive, but so would all the American troops who died in Iraq.</p> <p>âIf Donald Trump was the president, Captain Khan would be alive today, because he wouldâve never engaged in a war that didnât directly benefit this country,â Lewandowski said. âCaptain Khan would be alive today, as would 7,000 other U.S. soldiers.â</p> <p>But Trump didnât actually oppose the Iraq War from the beginning. BuzzFeedâs Andrew Kaczynski has documented that prior to the March 2003 invasion, Trump said he supported it. In September 2002, Howard Stern asked him âAre you for invading Iraq?â âYeah, I guess so,â Trump replied. Thereâs no evidence of Trump opposing the Iraq war prior to it beginning.</p> <p>Sunday night, Trumpâs vice president choice Mike Pence released a statement that began, âDonald Trump and I believe that Captain Humayun Khan is an American hero and his family, like all Gold Star families, should be cherished by every American.â But on Monday morning, Trump was still going after the Khan family on Twitter:</p> <p>Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same â Nice! â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2016</p> <p>This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart! â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2016</p> <p>Pence, like Hillary Clinton, voted for the October 2002 Iraq Resolution that gave President George W. Bush the authorization to invade months later.</p> <p>On CNN on Sunday, Khizr Khan made a case that Republican leaders have a moral obligation to repudiate Trump.</p> <p>Lewandowski, meanwhile, is getting paid by CNN for his political analysis despite the fact heâs contractually barred from criticizing Trump.</p>",Right,Left
fda7ff03-59a2-4e8c-bd8d-096f0410f9a3,Comey Made False Claim About Huma Abedin At Congressional Hearing,"The former Acting Attorney General tells a Senate subcommittee that she repeatedly informed the White House that former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was engaging in ""problematic"" conduct.","<p>FBI Director Jim Comey overstated a bombshell claim he made in a Senate hearing last week about Huma Abedinâs handling of her boss Hillary Clintonâs emails.</p> <p>During testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey said that Abedin had âforwarded hundreds and thousands of emails, some of which contain classified informationâ to a laptop owned by her husband, Anthony Weiner.</p> <p>But sources close to the email investigation told both ProPublica and The Washington Post that Comey grossly overstated the number of emails Abedin forwarded to Weinerâs computer. They said Abedin did so a few times but did not make a regular practice of it, as Comey had claimed.</p> <p>Comeyâs comments at the hearing were significant because he cited Abedinâs frequent forwarding of Clinton emails to explain why the FBI decided to re-open its email investigation in late October, just before the election.</p> <p>ProPublica reports that the FBI is considering sending a letter to Congress clearing up Comeyâs error.</p> <p>Comey was heavily criticized for re-opening the Clinton email case, which had been closed in July. The decision was made after agents discovered Clinton emails on Weinerâs laptop during an investigation into illicit messages that the disgraced former congressman sent a 15-year-old girl. Agents who worked the email investigation believed that the emails may have been from the early days of Clintonâs State Department tenure. Investigators had been unable to obtain those records.</p> <p>Comey closed the investigation days later, saying that a review showed that the emails were copies of records that the FBI already possessed. He has faced heavy criticism from Democrats who believe that re-opening the email probe was one of the factors leading to Clintonâs loss to President Trump.</p> <p>Comey also said last week that both Abedin and Weiner âpotentiallyâ broke the law.</p> <p>According to ProPublicaâs sources, Clintonâs emails wound up on Weinerâs laptop after she backed up her BlackBerry on the device.</p> <p>FBI investigators had identified 12 emails on Weinerâs laptop that contained unmarked classified information. It is not clear whether any of those were forwarded by Abedin.</p> <p>Follow Chuck on Twitter</p>",Left,Right
