## Repository Structure

- `hit_inputs/`: Input article metadata used to generate MTurk HITs (snippets, doc ID, event). Each task in MTurk is denoted as a HIT. The snippets and docs here were used to generate the HTML page for the workers to annotate.
- `annotations_raw/`: Raw annotation data from MTurk (CSV exports).
- `gold/`: Final, conflict-resolved annotations and agreement statistics.
- `docs/`: Annotation task templates, qualification instructions, and manual audit notes.
