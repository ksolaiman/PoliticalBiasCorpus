    "If you haven't already, you'll need to setup MTurk and AWS accounts that are linked together to use MTurk with Python. The MTurk account will be used to post tasks to the MTurk crowd and the AWS accounts will be used to connect to MTurk via API and provide access to any additional AWS resources that are needed to execute your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you don't have an AWS account already, visit https://aws.amazon.com and create an account you can use for your project.\n",
    "2. If you don't have an MTurk Requester account already, visit https://requester.mturk.com and create a new account.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've setup your accounts, you will need to link them together. When logged into both the root of your AWS account and your MTurk account, visit https://requester.mturk.com/developer to link them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "From your AWS console create a new AWS IAM User or select an existing one you plan to use. Add the AmazonMechanicalTurkFullAccess policy to your user. Then select the Security Credentials tab and create a new Access Key, copy the Access Key and Secret Access Key for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't installed the awscli yet, install it with pip (pip install awscli) and configure a profile using the access key and secret key above (aws configure --profile mturk). \n",
    "\n",
    "To post tasks to MTurk for Workers to complete you will first need to add funds to your account that will be used to reward Workers. Visit https://requester.mturk.com/account to get started with as little as $1.00.\n",

    "MTurk has a Sandbox environment that can be used for testing. Workers won't work see your tasks in the Sandbox but you can log in to do them yourself to test the task interface at https://workersandbox.mturk.com. It's recommended you test first in the Sandbox to make sure your task returns the data you need before moving to the Production environment. There is no cost to use the Sandbox environment."

       "    '<marker><marker>Donald Trump needed to give the speech of his life. He did that, and much more. He laid out an inspiring American Manifesto for our troubled times. And he did it his way. Not surprisingly, from start to finish, it is muscular and bold, leavened only by appeals to racial harmony and pledges of compassion for all. It offers a prominent nod to Bernie Sanders’ supporters in a bid to get some to jump the Democratic ship. Most important, it keeps faith with his campaign themes of putting forgotten Americans first. In contrasting his view with his opponent’s, the Republican nominee put it this way: “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.” And “I am your voice.” And then this: “There can be no prosperity without law and order.” On paper, the speech is powerful, and it was delivered with all the might Trump could muster. Passionate and occasionally strident, then mellow and playful, he revealed a full Trump Doctrine that weaves together what has often seemed random threads and instincts into a more coherent vision. He would unleash America’s energy production, use trade deals to help blue-collar workers and fix the broken immigration system so that cheap labor doesn’t undercut wages and overwhelm our social safety net. He would ensure public safety, rebuild the military and destroy global terrorism. And he forcefully and repeatedly cemented the image of the GOP as the pro-police party, a strong contrast with Democrats, who are recklessly becoming the anti-police party. Trump laid out such a huge undertaking, sweeping in its goals and potential impacts, that achieving even half of it would lead to an economic revival and end the nation’s crisis of confidence. If he focused on just what he outlined last night, and he should, Trump would be a very busy man every minute for the next four years. In that context, he addressed the inevitable sense that little change can come in a nation so polarized and gridlocked by reminding the raucous convention that he wasn’t even supposed to be standing before them. And in a line that captured his remarkable attack on the political status quo, he said, “The politicians have talked about this for years, but I’m going to do it.” There is, at this point, no reason to believe he doesn’t mean every word of it. Whatever his past habits and lifestyle, whatever caricature he has been reduced to, the seriousness of his purpose is no longer in doubt. He is a man on a mission. As befits an acceptance speech, the promises flowed like water, yet the important things stand out. This one, from his prepared remarks, was especially powerful: “On January 20th of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.” He was blistering on Hillary Clinton, saying her legacy as secretary of state was “death, destruction, terrorism and weakness.” Nor did he spare President Obama, accusing him of using “the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color” and saying he “has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.” Trump then added: “This administration has failed America’s inner cities. It’s failed them on education. It’s failed them on jobs. It’s failed them on crime. It’s failed them at every level.” The stirring speech saved what had been a mediocre convention, with sloppy mistakes leading to distracting controversies and fueling fears that Trump and his team still are not ready for prime time. Delegates were not so much divided as dispirited over the prospect that the party would once again lose a very winnable race. Especially with the well-oiled and well-funded Clinton machine revving up its engines with attack ads and with her message amplified by the left-wing media echo chamber, Trumpsters suddenly faced an enthusiasm gap. Rows of empty seats in the Quicken Loans Arena seemed symbolic of sagging hopes. A turning point might have come Wednesday night, during the booing of rival Ted Cruz for refusing to endorse Trump. What started with restlessness from the New York delegation quickly spread, and by the time he slinked off the stage, Cruz suffered a stunning and unanimous rebuke. That rare moment of genuine unity, followed by Mike Pence’s workmanlike acceptance speech as the VP nominee, set the stage for the finale. Indeed, no matter what had come before, it was always going to be up to Trump himself. He’s the nominee and the whole venture rises or falls on his performance. It now rises. He delivered a stemwinder for the ages. If he wins, and can deliver on his vision, remember this speech. Like Ronald Reagan’s in 1976, Trump’s 2016 address could mark the start of a desperately needed American revival. As he said near the end, “America is back.” Imagine that — and pray he is right.<marker>',\n",

       "    '<marker>2010 <marker><marker>beautiful <marker>Donald Trump is not a candidate the American people would turn to in normal times. He’s too inexperienced, too eccentric, too volatile, too risky. Voting Trump is burning down the house to collect the insurance money — you don’t do it unless things are really, really bad. Here is Trump’s problem: Things are not really, really bad. In fact, things are doing much better than when President Obama came into office. Unemployment is 4.9 percent nationally — a number Trump knows is far from a crisis, because it’s lower than the unemployment rate Mike Pence is presiding over in Indiana, and Trump keeps bragging about his running mate’s economic record. The deficit has gone down in recent years, and the stock market has gone up. The end of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars mean fewer Americans are dying abroad. A plurality approve of the job Obama is doing. So Trump needs to convince voters that things are bad, even if they’re not. He needs to make Americans afraid again. And tonight, he tried. \"Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation,\" Trump said. \"The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\" As Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Obama, wrote on Twitter, this was Trump’s \"Nightmare in America\" speech. The address had one goal, and one goal only: to persuade Americans that their country is a dangerous, besieged hellscape, and only Donald Trump can fix it. And so Trump spoke of the \"illegal immigrants with criminal records\" who are \"tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\" He warned of the gangs, violence, and drugs \"pouring into our communities.\" He invoked \"the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.\" Perhaps the night’s ugliest moment came when he spoke of Sarah Root, a college student killed by a drunk driver who was also an unauthorized immigrant. \"I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family,\" Trump said. \"But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.\" For the record, almost 10,000 people were killed in America by drunk drivers in 2010 — the overwhelming majority of them by American citizens. Trump had neither answers for nor interest in their deaths. And it is when you tug on these threads that Trump’s speech unspools and its grossness, and uselessness, becomes clear. There are many ways in which Americans are actually not safe. More than 600,000 Americans died of heart disease in 2015, many of them unnecessarily. More than 130,000 Americans died in accidents. More than 40,000 died by suicide. There were a record number of drug overdoses in 2014, and gun deaths in America are far beyond those in any developed country. These tragedies can be ameliorated by policy. Cigarettes can be taxed, alcohol regulated, addicts treated, guns made less accessible. But Trump wasn’t interested in making Americans safer, and so he did not mention any of these policies. He was interested in making Americans more afraid, and so he focused on the dangers that scare us, as opposed to the ones that truly threaten us. \"The first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities,\" he said. \"Liberate.\" The America Trump speaks of requires an occupying force sent by a strongman to free and stabilize cities that have fallen into anarchy. But our cities have not fallen into anarchy. Our borders are not swarming with illegal immigrants. Murder rates remain far below what the America of the \\'70s, \\'80s, and \\'90s experienced. Terrorism is a horror, but successful terrorist attacks are a rarity, and one that would be most straightforwardly addressed through gun control. No liberation is necessary. \"In this race for the White House,\" Trump said, \"I am the law and order candidate.\" And the law and order candidate can only win if there is a crisis of lawlessness and disorder. But there isn’t. Trump isn’t worried about your safety. He is worried about his own electoral prospects. And this is what made Trump’s speech so truly ugly. It is one thing to whip up fear of the Other when the Other is a threat. But it is fully another to try to scare the shit out of Americans because you’re afraid they won’t vote for you unless they’re terrified. It is demagogic to warn, on national television, of foreign criminals \"roaming\" our streets simply because you’re behind in the polls. It’s telling that Trump fears only the threats that can be blamed on outsiders while ignoring the more lethal, more pervasive killers that afflict the citizenry. Trump’s speech was a procession of horrors for which he did not even bother to propose real solutions. He has no actual fix to immigration, no theories on how to reduce crime. Here, his statement bordered on self-parody. \"I have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end,\" he said. \"Beginning on January 20, 2017, safety will be restored.\" But then, perhaps there’s truth to his absurd promises: When the crisis is invented, the solution is simpler. Once Trump no longer needs the nation to be afraid, he will stop scaring it. It is his nightmare, and only he can wake us from it.\\r\\r<marker>Donald Trump is not a candidate the American people would turn to in normal times. He’s too inexperienced, too eccentric, too volatile, too risky. Voting Trump is burning down the house to collect the insurance money — you don’t do it unless things are really, really bad. Here is Trump’s problem: Things are not really, really bad. In fact, things are doing much better than when President Obama came into office. Unemployment is 4.9 percent nationally — a number Trump knows is far from a crisis, because it’s lower than the unemployment rate Mike Pence is presiding over in Indiana, and Trump keeps bragging about his running mate’s economic record. The deficit has gone down in recent years, and the stock market has gone up. The end of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars mean fewer Americans are dying abroad. A plurality approve of the job Obama is doing. So Trump needs to convince voters that things are bad, even if they’re not. He needs to make Americans afraid again. And tonight, he tried. \"Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation,\" Trump said. \"The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\" As Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Obama, wrote on Twitter, this was Trump’s \"Nightmare in America\" speech. The address had one goal, and one goal only: to persuade Americans that their country is a dangerous, besieged hellscape, and only Donald Trump can fix it. And so Trump spoke of the \"illegal immigrants with criminal records\" who are \"tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\" He warned of the gangs, violence, and drugs \"pouring into our communities.\" He invoked \"the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.\" Perhaps the night’s ugliest moment came when he spoke of Sarah Root, a college student killed by a drunk driver who was also an unauthorized immigrant. \"I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family,\" Trump said. \"But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.\" For the record, almost 10,000 people were killed in America by drunk drivers in 2010 — the overwhelming majority of them by American citizens. Trump had neither answers for nor interest in their deaths. And it is when you tug on these threads that Trump’s speech unspools and its grossness, and uselessness, becomes clear. There are many ways in which Americans are actually not safe. More than 600,000 Americans died of heart disease in 2015, many of them unnecessarily. More than 130,000 Americans died in accidents. More than 40,000 died by suicide. There were a record number of drug overdoses in 2014, and gun deaths in America are far beyond those in any developed country.

       "    '<marker><marker><marker>desperate <marker><marker>policy <marker>Here are four names, long forgotten, that should be noted today: Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Pablo Morales, and Mario de la Peña. They were three U.S. citizens and one permanent resident. They were pilots with Brothers to the Rescue, the outfit that looks for Cuban refugees, as they are stranded or desperate on the sea. On February 24, 1996, the four pilots were shot out of the sky by the Cuban dictatorship’s forces. The planes were in international airspace at the time. The Castro government killed the men simply because they were trying to help innocent Cubans. The Castros had the help of a spy network in the United States. U.S. authorities apprehended five of them, who were then given the full benefit of our justice system (including appeal after appeal). Eventually, they were convicted of espionage and conspiracy to commit murder. These men, known as “The Cuban Five,” were long a cause célèbre on the left. “Free the Cuban Five!” signs were seen all over the United States and Europe, especially Europe. In October 2011, the first of them was released, having served out his term. He made a taunting statement: “We still have four brothers whom we have to rescue.” “Brothers to the Rescue” — get it? A second Cuban spy finished his term in February 2014. So that left a Cuban Three. For years now, the Obama administration has sworn that it would never swap these Cuban spies for Alan Gross, the American aid worker who was taken hostage by the Cuban dictatorship in December 2009. The implied moral equivalence would be obnoxious, Obama officials said. Secretary of State John Kerry repeated this last year. That is what the administration has now done, however: swap the Cuban spies for Gross. But we got more: a spy of our own, a Cuban national who, unlike the Castros’ spies, worked on the side of democracy and freedom. Moreover, the Cuban dictatorship has apparently released, or agreed to release, 53 of its political prisoners. This might startle or embarrass certain people on the left, who have long denied that the Castros have political prisoners at all. Earlier this year, Jorge Dominguez, the famed Harvard professor, denied on CNN that the Castros had any political prisoners. There are more where those 53 came from, too. If President Obama had done nothing more than swap the Cuban spies for Gross and our own agent, we could have lived with that. Indeed, we might have defended it. But Obama has taken the momentous step of normalizing relations with the Castros’ Cuba. Thus has the Left achieved a dream it started dreaming on January 1, 1959, the first day of the dictatorship. The previous administration, that of George W. Bush, offered a program of carrots and sticks: relaxation of American policy in exchange for Cuban liberalization. Obama has acted unilaterally, giving the Cuban dictatorship, not just relaxation, but the ultimate: namely, full diplomatic relations. And this is a dictatorship, mind you, that is still murdering its democratic opponents. Two years ago, the democracy leader Oswaldo Payá was almost certainly killed by the regime (in one of those car accidents that are not really accidents). (Stalin used to order these, too.) Obama, like everyone else in his camp, likes to say that longstanding American policy on Cuba has not “worked.” The word “worked” is interesting. In 2003, National Review’s Jay Nordlinger asked a dissident, René Montes de Oca, “What do you say to those Americans who say that our policy hasn’t ‘worked’? The Communist regime is still standing.” Montes answered, “At least you haven’t helped them,” unlike a good many European countries, for example. The new American policy will mean dollars to the regime (as opposed to Cubans themselves). The Castro dictatorship is an amazingly lucky dictatorship. When its sponsor, the Soviet Union, folded in 1991, the EU rushed in to pick up the slack. In the last 15 years, the dictatorship has been propped up by chavista Venezuela, with its massive oil wealth. Now, however, Venezuela is on the verge of political and economic collapse. And here we come, favoring the Cuban regime with normalization, plus associated goodies. Moreover, the administration is poised to strike Cuba from the State Department’s list of terror sponsors. If Cuba is removed — when it is removed — let it be because the Castros are no longer sponsoring terror, not because Obama is trying to appease. The Castros’ close relations with North Korea do not suggest reform in the global arena. The kidnapping of Alan Gross in December 2009 turned out to be a very good move for the Cuban regime. Like any good hostage-taker, the Castros used him as leverage, and got more out of him probably than they ever dreamed: full-scale relations with the U.S. Obama, however, would likely have granted these relations anyway. The release of Gross serves as a fig leaf. Here is a worry: Will other rogue regimes draw a lesson from this experience? Will they conclude that, if they take Americans hostage, they can get what they want out of Washington? Certainly out of Obama? The Cuban government is not legitimate, and never has been. It is a one-party dictatorship with a gulag, an archipelago of prisons into which democrats and dissidents are thrown. We hope that the new American policy — Obama’s policy — does not benefit the Cuban dictatorship and harm Cuban democrats. We fear that yesterday was a good day for the Castros and a bad day for the Cuban people, and for American foreign policy.\\r\\r<marker><marker>has<marker>Here are four names, long forgotten, that should be noted today: Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Pablo Morales, and Mario de la Peña.

These men, known as “The Cuban Five,” were long a cause célèbre on the left. “Free the Cuban Five!” signs were seen all over the United States and Europe, especially Europe. In October 2011, the first of them was released, having served out his term. He made a taunting statement: “We still have four brothers whom we have to rescue.” “Brothers to the Rescue” — get it? A second Cuban spy finished his term in February 2014. So that left a Cuban Three. For years now, the Obama administration has sworn that it would never swap these Cuban spies for Alan Gross, the American aid worker who was taken hostage by the Cuban dictatorship in December 2009. The implied moral equivalence would be obnoxious, Obama officials said. Secretary of State John Kerry repeated this last year. That is what the administration has now done, however: swap the Cuban spies for Gross. But we got more: a spy of our own, a Cuban national who, unlike the Castros’ spies, worked on the side of democracy and freedom. Moreover, the Cuban dictatorship has apparently released, or agreed to release, 53 of its political prisoners. This might startle or embarrass certain people on the left, who have long denied that the Castros have political prisoners at all. Earlier this year, Jorge Dominguez, the famed Harvard professor, denied on CNN that the Castros had any political prisoners. There are more where those 53 came from, too. If President Obama had done nothing more than swap the Cuban spies for Gross and our own agent, we could have lived with that. Indeed, we might have defended it. But Obama has taken the momentous step of normalizing relations with the Castros’ Cuba. Thus has the Left achieved a dream it started dreaming on January 1, 1959, the first day of the dictatorship. The previous administration, that of George W. Bush, offered a program of carrots and sticks: relaxation of American policy in exchange for Cuban liberalization. Obama has acted unilaterally, giving the Cuban dictatorship, not just relaxation, but the ultimate: namely, full diplomatic relations. And this is a dictatorship, mind you, that is still murdering its democratic opponents. Two years ago, the democracy leader Oswaldo Payá was almost certainly killed by the regime (in one of those car accidents that are not really accidents). (Stalin used to order these, too.) Obama, like everyone else in his camp, likes to say that longstanding American policy on Cuba has not “worked.” The word “worked” is interesting. In 2003, National Review’s Jay Nordlinger asked a dissident, René Montes de Oca, “What do you say to those Americans who say that our policy hasn’t ‘worked’? The Communist regime is still standing.” Montes answered, “At least you haven’t helped them,” unlike a good many European countries, for example. The new American policy will mean dollars to the regime (as opposed to Cubans themselves). The Castro dictatorship is an amazingly lucky dictatorship. When its sponsor, the Soviet Union, folded in 1991, the EU rushed in to pick up the slack. In the last 15 years, the dictatorship has been propped up by chavista Venezuela, with its massive oil wealth. Now, however, Venezuela is on the verge of political and economic collapse. And here we come, favoring the Cuban regime with normalization, plus associated goodies. Moreover, the administration is poised to strike Cuba from the State Department’s list of terror sponsors. If Cuba is removed — when it is removed — let it be because the Castros are no longer sponsoring terror, not because Obama is trying to appease. The Castros’ close relations with North Korea do not suggest reform in the global arena. The kidnapping of Alan Gross in December 2009 turned out to be a very good move for the Cuban regime. Like any good hostage-taker, the Castros used him as leverage, and got more out of him probably than they ever dreamed: full-scale relations with the U.S. Obama, however, would likely have granted these relations anyway. The release of Gross serves as a fig leaf. Here is a worry: Will other rogue regimes draw a lesson from this experience? Will they conclude that, if they take Americans hostage, they can get what they want out of Washington? Certainly out of Obama? The Cuban government is not legitimate, and never has been. It is a one-party dictatorship with a gulag, an archipelago of prisons into which democrats and dissidents are thrown. We hope that the new American policy — Obama’s policy — does not benefit the Cuban dictatorship and harm Cuban democrats. We fear that yesterday was a good day for the Castros and a bad day for the Cuban people, and for American foreign policy.\\r\\r<marker>Here are four names, long forgotten, that should be noted today: Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Pablo Morales, and Mario de la Peña. They were three U.S. citizens and one permanent resident. They were pilots with Brothers to the Rescue, the outfit that looks for Cuban refugees, as they are stranded or desperate on the sea. On February 24, 1996, the four pilots were shot out of the sky by the Cuban dictatorship’s forces. The planes were in international airspace at the time. The Castro government killed the men simply because they were trying to help innocent Cubans. The Castros had the help of a spy network in the United States. U.S. authorities apprehended five of them, who were then given the full benefit of our justice system (including appeal after appeal).
