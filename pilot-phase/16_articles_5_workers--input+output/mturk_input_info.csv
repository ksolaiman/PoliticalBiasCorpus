6e2ec9f5-eb67-4422-84d8-3d68b1a50220,From Whitewater to Benghazi: A Clinton-Scandal Primer,"Oops, never mind! That‰Ûªs FBI Director James Comey‰Ûªs new message to Congress and, by extension, the American public on Sunday. A little over a week ago, Comey shook the presidential election with a letter to the chairs of several congressional committees, announcing that the FBI had found a new tranche of emails pertinent to its investigation into Hillary Clinton‰Ûªs use of a private email server while secretary of state. The emails came from an unrelated case, he said‰ÛÓsince widely reported to be an investigation into alleged sexts to a teenager from Anthony Weiner, whose estranged wife is a top Clinton aide‰ÛÓand there was no timeline for finishing the review. The revelation gave new life to the struggling Donald Trump campaign, which seized on the matter as proof of Clinton‰Ûªs bad judgment. Her poll numbers, as well as her favorability figures and Democratic enthusiasm, sagged. New leaks began dripping out of the FBI on a daily basis, along with allegations that the bureau was trying to tip the election toward Trump. The Clinton campaign demanded that Comey say more, but no information was forthcoming.","But in a new letter on Sunday, Comey revealed that FBI agents had been working ‰ÛÏaround the clock‰Ûù to look at the emails. ‰ÛÏDuring that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State,‰Ûù Comey wrote. ‰ÛÏBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.‰Ûù In other words, it was all much ado about nothing. Comey‰Ûªs recommended in July was that although Clinton had been ‰ÛÏextremely careless‰Ûù with classified information, there was no grounds for charging her with a crime. Put more bluntly, the FBI altered the course of the presidential campaign for what amounts to a fire drill. This doesn‰Ûªt mean the email story is gone entirely. On Friday, a new release showed that in at least one case Clinton forwarded emails to her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, that the government now labels classified. The chain in question was released on November 4, as part of the ongoing release of Clinton‰Ûªs emails from her time as secretary of state. The messages appeared to be related to climate talks in Copenhagen in December 2009, although they were redacted so that it is impossible to tell. They were sent to an email address that Chelsea Clinton used under an alias, ‰ÛÏDiane Reynolds.‰Ûù It was not marked classified at the time. The emails and the private server through which they operated have been a defining story of the Clinton campaign. In March 2015, The New York Times first reported on Clinton‰Ûªs use of a private email address and a private server during her time at Foggy Bottom. The story has dogged Clinton ever since, raising questions about her judgment and trustworthiness.","Who? Both Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin are among Clinton‰Ûªs longest-serving and closest aides. Abedin remains involved in her campaign (and she‰Ûªs also married to Anthony Weiner). When? January 2009-February 2013 How serious is it? This is arcane stuff, to be sure. There are questions about conflict of interest‰ÛÓsuch as whether Teneo clients might have benefited from special treatment by the State Department while Abedin worked for both. To a great extent, this is just an extension of the tangle of conflicts presented by the Clinton Foundation and the many overlapping roles of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Sidney Blumenthal What? A former journalist, Blumenthal was a top aide in the second term of the Bill Clinton administration and helped on messaging during the bad old days. He served as an adviser to Hillary Clinton‰Ûªs 2008 presidential campaign, and when she took over the State Department, she sought to hire Blumenthal. Obama aides, apparently still smarting over his role in attacks on candidate Obama, refused the request, so Clinton just sought out his counsel informally.
