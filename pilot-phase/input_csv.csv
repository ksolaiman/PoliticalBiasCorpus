He laid out an inspiring American Manifesto for our troubled times.","Not surprisingly, from start to finish, it is muscular and bold, leavened only by appeals to racial harmony and pledges of compassion for all. It offers a prominent nod to Bernie Sandersâ€™ supporters in a bid to get some to jump the Democratic ship.","If he wins, and can deliver on his vision, remember this speech. Like Ronald Reaganâ€™s in 1976, Trumpâ€™s 2016 address could mark the start of a desperately needed American revival.

6e2ec9f5-eb67-4422-84d8-3d68b1a50220,From Whitewater to Benghazi: A Clinton-Scandal Primer,"Oops, never mind! Thatâ€™s FBI Director James Comeyâ€™s new message to Congress and, by extension, the American public on Sunday. A little over a week ago, Comey shook the presidential election with a letter to the chairs of several congressional committees, announcing that the FBI had found a new tranche of emails pertinent to its investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while secretary of state. The emails came from an unrelated case, he saidâ€”since widely reported to be an investigation into alleged sexts to a teenager from Anthony Weiner, whose estranged wife is a top Clinton aideâ€”and there was no timeline for finishing the review. The revelation gave new life to the struggling Donald Trump campaign, which seized on the matter as proof of Clintonâ€™s bad judgment. Her poll numbers, as well as her favorability figures and Democratic enthusiasm, sagged. New leaks began dripping out of the FBI on a daily basis, along with allegations that the bureau was trying to tip the election toward Trump. The Clinton campaign demanded that Comey say more, but no information was forthcoming.","But in a new letter on Sunday, Comey revealed that FBI agents had been working â€œaround the clockâ€ù to look at the emails. â€œDuring that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State,â€ù Comey wrote. â€œBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.â€ù In other words, it was all much ado about nothing. Comeyâ€™s recommended in July was that although Clinton had been â€œextremely carelessâ€ù with classified information, there was no grounds for charging her with a crime. Put more bluntly, the FBI altered the course of the presidential campaign for what amounts to a fire drill. This doesnâ€™t mean the email story is gone entirely. On Friday, a new release showed that in at least one case Clinton forwarded emails to her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, that the government now labels classified. The chain in question was released on November 4, as part of the ongoing release of Clintonâ€™s emails from her time as secretary of state. The messages appeared to be related to climate talks in Copenhagen in December 2009, although they were redacted so that it is impossible to tell. They were sent to an email address that Chelsea Clinton used under an alias, â€œDiane Reynolds.â€ù It was not marked classified at the time. The emails and the private server through which they operated have been a defining story of the Clinton campaign. In March 2015, The New York Times first reported on Clintonâ€™s use of a private email address and a private server during her time at Foggy Bottom. The story has dogged Clinton ever since, raising questions about her judgment and trustworthiness.","Who? Both Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin are among Clintonâ€™s longest-serving and closest aides. Abedin remains involved in her campaign (and sheâ€™s also married to Anthony Weiner). When? January 2009-February 2013 How serious is it? This is arcane stuff, to be sure. There are questions about conflict of interestâ€”such as whether Teneo clients might have benefited from special treatment by the State Department while Abedin worked for both. To a great extent, this is just an extension of the tangle of conflicts presented by the Clinton Foundation and the many overlapping roles of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Sidney Blumenthal What? A former journalist, Blumenthal was a top aide in the second term of the Bill Clinton administration and helped on messaging during the bad old days. He served as an adviser to Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2008 presidential campaign, and when she took over the State Department, she sought to hire Blumenthal. Obama aides, apparently still smarting over his role in attacks on candidate Obama, refused the request, so Clinton just sought out his counsel informally. At the same time, Blumenthal was drawing a check from the Clinton Foundation."
