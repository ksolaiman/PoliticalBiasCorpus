If the early reports are any indication, untangling the former (and possibly future) first couple’s professional and charity work is going to be an arduous task for journalists, and the findings may test the limits of America’s interest in Clinton scandals.","<p>Photo: John Moore/2014 Getty Images</p> <p>Earlier this week, the New York Times teased the forthcoming book Clinton Cash, in which conservative author Peter Schweizer alleges that foreign entities made donations to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for favors from Hillary Clinton’s State Department. Several news outlets, including the Times, received early access to the book to fuel their own reporting on the subject, and Senator Rand Paul declared that the revelations would be “alarming” and “mind boggling.”</p> <p>The first round of those reports was published on Wednesday, and so far Paul was right — but not in the way he intended. Sifting through the connections between foreign CEOs’ business dealings, foundation donations that were only partially disclosed, speaking fees collected by Bill Clinton, and decisions made by the former secretary of State is certainly “mind boggling,” but so far there’s no smoking gun.</p> <p>The biggest revelation so far concerns the sale of one of the United States’ largest uranium mines to Russia’s state atomic energy agency, Rosatom. The Wyoming mine — which could produce as much as half of the U.S. uranium supply this year, according to The Wall Street Journal — was formerly owned by the Canadian company Uranium One, but from 2009 to 2013 the Russians took control of the company. Because the $610 million sale could have national security implications for the U.S., it had to be approved by a federal committee composed of several government agencies. Here’s how the Clintons were involved: Hillary’s State Department was one of the agencies that approved the deal in 2010, and the New York Times reports that during that time Uranium One’s chairman, Ian Telfer, made four donations to the Clinton Foundation via his family foundation, totaling $2.35 million. Despite the Clintons’ agreement with the Obama administration, those donations were not disclosed.</p> <p>While that sounds fishy, so far there’s no evidence that the donations affected the deal’s approval. In addition to the secretary of State, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) includes the attorney general and the secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy. It’s also possible that the decision was made by deputies or assistant secretaries in those agencies, not the cabinet members themselves. The Clinton campaign provided a statement from a former assistant secretary of State who said Clinton “never intervened” while he was handling CFIUS matters. Telfer said he made the donations to support his business partner, the Canadian mining executive Frank Giustra, and “the donations started before there was any idea of this takeover.”</p> <p>Speaking of Giustra, Politico reports that he’s the subject of another tale from Clinton Cash. Giustra sits on the Clinton Foundation’s board, has pledged more than $100 million to the foundation, and cofounded the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership. The chapter “Rainforest Riches” reportedly details Giustra’s close relationship with Bill Clinton and notes that he benefited from the secretary of State’s support of a 2011 free trade agreement with Colombia.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said that’s among the “most laughable” theories in the book, since Giustra donated to the foundation prior to 2008, but during the primary both she and Obama opposed the deal. “Her support for the deal came only after she joined the Obama administration, when key worker protections were added to the package,” Fallon said. “By that point, the agreement was an administration-wide priority, and then-Secretary Clinton’s statements in support of the deal reflected the administration’s position.”</p> <p>A source with “knowledge of the Clinton Foundation’s fund-raising operation” confirmed the obvious to the Times: Many donors are giving to the Clinton Foundation because they hope the money will advance their cause. “Why do you think they are doing it — because they love them?” the source quipped.

He was 82. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid</p> <p>Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved a series of deals that gave Russia’s atomic energy agency control of one-fifth of the uranium produced in the U.S. as major stakeholders in the transaction donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>The New York Times published the bombshell expose Wednesday night. The article advances on information contained in Peter Schweizer’s highly-anticipated book, “Clinton Cash.” The book, set to be released May 5, has generated major pushback from the Clinton camp which claims that it is conservative propaganda.</p> <p>The uranium deal begins with Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining tycoon, who has pledged $100 million to the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>Giustra formed a company in the mid-2000s called UrAsia Energy which sought mining rights in Kazakhstan. Giustra obtained those rights after a fortuitous Sept. 6, 2005, meeting with Kazakhstan’s authoritarian president Nursultan Nazarbayev. Bill Clinton flew with Giustra on his private jet to the Central Asian nation, and sat in on that hours-long talk.</p> <p>Following that meeting, Clinton went on public television to praise Nazarbayev, who has been accused of rigging elections and other human rights violations. Days after this appearance, which The Times’ reporter, Jo Becker, characterizes in her article as a propaganda ploy, the Kazakh government signed off on a deal that granted Giustra’s UrAsia access to its mines.</p> <p>After this, Giustra gave Clinton’s foundation a $31 million donation. Giustra also pledged to donate another $100 million to the charity. Giustra has denied that any money was given to the Clinton charity in exchange for help with business. He has said that his work with Clinton is centered on humanitarian and philanthropic efforts.</p> <p>In 2007, UrAsia merged with a South African company called Uranium One in a $3.5 billion deal. Uranium One’s chairman was Ian Tefler, a longtime business partner of Giustra’s who donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation between 2009 and 2012. Giustra said he sold his stake in Uranium One in 2007.</p> <p>Adding to the suspicious nature of Tefler’s donation, which passed through a private foundation set up in Canada, the Fernwood Foundation, is that the Clinton Foundation did not include it on its donors list. Hillary Clinton promised to release the full donor list when she agreed to serve as secretary of state in the Obama White House.</p> <p>That omission provides more fodder for critics who have accused the Clintons of being overly secretive regarding their charity’s operations.</p> <p>Two series of transactions involving uranium mining unfolded at around the same time which eventually ceded control of 20 percent of the uranium produced in the U.S. to the Russians.</p> <p>Uranium One was gobbling up uranium plays throughout the western U.S. while Russia’s Rosatom was seeking to ramp up its investment in Uranium One. That effectively served as a backdoor for Russia to gain access to American uranium.</p> <p>In June 2009, Uranium One leaned on the American Embassy in Kazakhstan to approve a deal that would allow a subsidiary of Rosatom, ARMZ, to purchase a 17 percent stake of the company.</p> <p>Rosatom, through ARMZ, pushed for a larger stake the next year. It offered Uranium One shareholders a deal which would allow it to control 51 percent of the company.</p> <p>As Rosatom’s offer for the majority stake in Uranium One was still up in the air, Bill Clinton profited personally by giving a speech in Moscow which was paid for by a Russian investment bank, Renaissance Capital. Renaissance Capital also happened to be a major promoter of Uranium One stock, The Times reported.</p> <p>Four members of Congress and Wyoming U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, wrote President Obama condemning the proposed deal. Barrasso said it was “alarming” that Russia wanted to gain access to domestic uranium. Uranium One shareholders were also concerned that Rosatom was a “Russian state agent,” according to The Times.</p> <p>Despite those concerns, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a panel made up of members of the various U.S. cabinets, approved the deal.</p> <p>The Times was unable to report if Clinton herself weighed in on the decision to approve the transaction. However, Clinton has been described as a micromanager of State Department decisions.</p> <p>The majority stake in Uranium One gave Russia control of one-fifth of the uranium produced in the U.S., The Times notes. The concern about that control is not over the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but, rather, control of a major source of nuclear energy production.</p> <p>WATCH:</p> <p>Follow Chuck on Twitter</p>",Hillary and the Russian Uranium Deal,5.0,-5.0,"[""5"",""3""]",,Right,Lean Right,Right,True

The Wisconsin congressman and GOP vice presidential candidate repeatedly chided President Barack Obama for blaming the jobs and housing crises on his predecessor, saying that his habit of ""forever shifting blame to the last administration, is getting old. The man assumed office almost four years ago -– isn’t it about time he assumed responsibility?""</p> <p>Ryan then noted that Obama, while campaigning for president, promised that a GM plant in Wisconsin would not shut down. ""That plant didn’t last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And that’s how it is in so many towns today, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight,"" Ryan said.</p> <p>Except Obama didn't promise that. And the plant closed in December 2008 -- while George W. Bush was president.</p> <p>It was just one of several striking and demonstrably misleading elements of Ryan's much-anticipated acceptance speech. And it comes just days after Romney pollster Neil Newhouse warned, defending the campaign's demonstrably false ads claiming Obama removed work requirements from welfare, ""We're not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.""</p> <p>Ryan, for his part, slammed the president for not supporting a deficit commission report without mentioning that he himself had voted against it, helping to kill it.</p> <p>He also made a cornerstone of his argument the claim that Obama ""funneled"" $716 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare. But he didn't mention that his own budget plan relies on those very same savings.</p> <p>Ryan also put responsibility for Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. government debt at Obama's doorstep. But he didn't mention that S&P itself, in explaining its downgrade, referred to the debt ceiling standoff. That process of raising the debt ceiling was only politicized in the last Congress, driven by House Republicans, led in the charge by Paul Ryan.</p> <p>The credit rater also said it worried that Republicans would never agree to tax increases. “We have changed our assumption on [revenue] because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues,” S&P wrote.</p> <p>Jodie Layton, a convention goer from Utah watching the Ryan speech, said she was blown away by the vice presidential candidate. But she said she was surprised to hear that after his speech about taking responsibility, he'd pinned a Bush-era plant closing on Obama.</p> <p>""It closed in December 2008?"" she asked, making sure she heard a HuffPost reporter's question right. After a long pause, she said, ""It's happening a lot on both sides. It's to be expected.""</p> <p>Ryan has referenced the GM plant before, and his attack was debunked by the Detroit News, which called it inaccurate. ""In fact, Obama made no such promise and the plant halted production in December 2008, when President George W. Bush was in office,"" Detroit News reporter David Sherpardson wrote earlier this month. ""Obama did speak at the plant in February 2008, and suggested that a government partnership with automakers could keep the plant open, but made no promises as Ryan suggested.""</p> <p>After the speech, CNN's political commentators focused mostly on Ryan's misstatements, demonstrating the degree to which they were evident.</p> <p>Top Obama adviser David Axelrod jumped on the GM factory claim. ""Again, Ryan blames Obama for a GM plant that closed under Bush. But then, they did say they wouldn't 'let fact checkers get in the way.'""</p> <p>Ryan, however, appears to have made the calculation that the misleading won't hurt him with voters. He might be right. CNN's David Gergen, while acknowledging some ""misstatements"" in Ryan's address, suggested that pundits focus elsewhere. ""But let's not forget that this was a speech about big ideas,"" he told his audience.</p> <p>UPDATE:</p> <p>For more on the closure process, which was announced in mid-2008, see the local Gazette Xtra. More than 2,000 Janesville GM workers were laid off immediately; another 57 stayed on until April 2009 as production wound down.</p> <p>UPDATE: 8/30 --</p> <p>Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Paul Ryan, defended the congressman's remarks in an email to The Huffington Post. “It’s President Obama who needs to explain his words,"" Buck said. ""The facts are clear: when the GM plant went on standby the President told the people of Wisconsin he would ‘lead an effort to retool’ it and restart production. But when the bailout’s winners and losers were decided, Janesville ended up losing. The people of Wisconsin, like so many Americans, are still waiting for the President’s imaginary recovery.”</p> <p>Buck is referring to an October 2008 Associated Press report which quotes then-candidate Barack Obama saying that if he's elected, he will ""lead an effort to retool plants like the GM facility."" That's different, of course, than saying he'd retool the plant itself, but it adds context to Ryan's argument.</p> <p>Conservative media outlets have clashed with mainstream fact-checkers who have debunked Ryan's claim by noting that the plant didn't fully wind down until Obama was president in April 2009, when the final 57 workers were laid off.</p> <p>Ryan's campaign, notably, is not reaching for that technicality to defend his claim. Instead it is arguing the broader point that when the plant closed is less important than the fact it has not re-opened.</p> <p>Ryan, during his speech, referenced Obama's speech in Janesville in Feb. 2008.</p> <p>“I know that General Motors received some bad news yesterday, and I know how hard your governor has fought to keep jobs in this plant. But I also know how much progress you’ve made—how many hybrids and fuel-efficient vehicles you’re churning out,"" Obama said at the time. “And I believe that if our government is there to support you and give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition, that this plant will be here for another 100 years.”</p> <p>Government support for the plant, however, was a big if -- and it wasn't an if that came through for the plant under the Bush administration. Romney, meanwhile, opposed the auto bailout, which puts the campaign in the awkward spot of criticizing Obama for not intervening enough in the private sector with government bailouts.</p> <p>The Washington Post's Greg Sargent on Thursday interviewed a Ryan-supporting Wisconsin businessman who argued that the plant may have been unsalvageable even with significant government support.</p> <p>""This morning, I spoke to a leading business official in Janesville, Wisconsin, who was at the center of efforts to save the GM plant — one who supports Paul Ryan — and he offered a nuanced version of the history that strains simplistic interpretations,"" Sargent reported.

The acerbic speech accused the president of leaving his legions of voters with little more than a record of squandered opportunities and broken promises as they stare at ""fading Obama posters"" and look for work.</p> <p>“It all started off with stirring speeches, Greek columns, the thrill of something new,” Ryan said. “Now all that’s left is a presidency adrift, surviving on slogans that already seem tired, grasping at a moment that has already passed, like a ship trying to sail on yesterday’s wind.”</p> <p>From start to finish, the speech was an unceasing assault on Obama’s record. By the end, he drew thunderous cheers and applause from the convention crowd. And as he has in the past, Ryan tried to draw a sharp contrast throughout.</p> <p>Obama’s term, he said, has been “a dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next, a government-planned life, a country where everything is free but us.”</p> <p>Ryan pledged a new direction: ""We will not duck the tough issues, we will lead.""</p> <p>He vowed to rein in the size of government, and called on the party to take the journey with them.</p> <p>“Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation’s economic problems,” Ryan said. “And I’m going to level with you. We don’t have that much time. But if we are serious, and smart, and we lead, we can do this.”</p> <p>Of the Democrats, he said, “Their moment came and went.”</p> <p>Ryan catalogued a litany of grievances against the president, from the stimulus and accompanying funding for companies like Solyndra -- “with their gold-plated connections … and make-believe markets” -- to the health care overhaul.</p> <p>His inner numbers-guy emerged as he tried to explain the disconnect between the economic crisis when Obama took office and Obama’s actions in those first couple years.</p> <p>“Here we were, faced with a massive job crisis – so deep that if everyone out of work stood in single file, that unemployment line would stretch the length of the entire American continent,” Ryan said. “You would think that any president, whatever his party, would make job creation, and nothing else, his first order of economic business.”</p> <p>He went on: “Instead, we got a long, divisive, all-or-nothing attempt to put the federal government in charge of health care.”</p> <p>Ryan also renewed the ticket’s pledge to repeal “ObamaCare” and continued to claim that he and Romney invite a debate about Medicare -- which Democrats have tried to use against Ryan because of his own controversial plan.</p> <p>But Ryan repeated the argument that the federal health care overhaul is the real danger for Medicare seniors because of the cuts it makes.</p> <p>“The greatest threat to Medicare is ObamaCare, and we’re going to stop it,” he said. “So our opponents can consider themselves on notice. In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the left isn’t going to work.”</p> <p>Ryan brought the crowd to its feet when he took the stage and again when he left it.</p> <p>""After four years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround,"" Ryan said at the top, ""and the man for the job is Gov. Mitt Romney.""</p> <p>Ryan’s speech sets the stage for Mitt Romney’s nomination acceptance speech Thursday, which will close out the party’s convention and be the GOP’s last word before Democrats convene in Charlotte, N.C., for their nomination gala.</p> <p>New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired up the crowd on the opening night, which was delayed by a day over Tropical Storm Isaac, but Christie left it to Ryan to get into the particulars of what a Romney-Ryan ticket would pledge to achieve for America.</p> <p>Those particulars have proved controversial.</p> <p>Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, is the author of a Medicare plan that has been a punching bag for Democrats for years now, but even more so since he was tapped as Romney’s running mate. Democrats continued to hammer Ryan on the morning of the speech, releasing a Web video that cast him as a regressive choice from a “bygone era.”</p> <p>Ryan, though, known for his strict fitness regimen and hobbies ranging from bow-hunting to heavy metal, has brought a vitality to the ticket and has challenged efforts to caricature him as a one-dimensional soak-the-poor conservative.</p> <p>His selection as GOP running mate was hailed by many conservatives as a serious choice for serious times -- which is how Ryan sought to cast the Romney-Ryan ticket Wednesday night going into the November election.</p> <p>Jazzed-up delegates pouring into the halls after the speech told FoxNews.com they liked what they heard.</p> <p>“I think he hit a home run,” said Gerry Geer, a 74-year-old Navy veteran and alternate delegate from Pennsylvania. “He brought up things that nobody has so far this week, like Solyndra.

On this measure, while it was Romney who ran the Olympics, Ryan earned the gold.</p> <p>The good news is that the Romney-Ryan campaign has likely created dozens of new jobs among the legions of additional fact checkers that media outlets are rushing to hire to sift through the mountain of cow dung that flowed from Ryan’s mouth. Said fact checkers have already condemned certain arguments that Ryan still irresponsibly repeated.</p> <p>Fact: While Ryan tried to pin the downgrade of the United States’ credit rating on spending under President Obama, the credit rating was actually downgraded because Republicans threatened not to raise the debt ceiling.</p> <p>Fact: While Ryan blamed President Obama for the shut down of a GM plant in Janesville, Wisconsin, the plant was actually closed under President George W. Bush. Ryan actually asked for federal spending to save the plant, while Romney has criticized the auto industry bailout that President Obama ultimately enacted to prevent other plants from closing.</p> <p>Fact: Though Ryan insisted that President Obama wants to give all the credit for private sector success to government, that isn't what the president said. Period.</p> <p>Fact: Though Paul Ryan accused President Obama of taking $716 billion out of Medicare, the fact is that that amount was savings in Medicare reimbursement rates (which, incidentally, save Medicare recipients out-of-pocket costs, too) and Ryan himself embraced these savings in his budget plan.</p> <p>Elections should be about competing based on your record in the past and your vision for the future, not competing to see who can get away with the most lies and distortions without voters noticing or bother to care. Both parties should hold themselves to that standard. Republicans should be ashamed that there was even one misrepresentation in Ryan’s speech but sadly, there were many.</p> <p>3. Distracting</p> <p>And then there’s what Ryan didn’t talk about.</p> <p>Ryan didn’t mention his extremist stance on banning all abortions with no exception for rape or incest, a stance that is out of touch with 75% of American voters.</p> <p>Ryan didn’t mention his previous plan to hand over Social Security to Wall Street.</p> <p>Ryan didn’t mention his numerous votes to raise spending and balloon the deficit when George W. Bush was president.</p> <p>Ryan didn’t mention how his budget would eviscerate programs that help the poor and raise taxes on 95% of Americans in order to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires even further and increase — yes, increase —the deficit.</p> <p>These aspects of Ryan’s resume and ideology are sticky to say the least. He would have been wise to tackle them head on and try and explain them away in his first real introduction to voters. But instead of Ryan airing his own dirty laundry, Democrats will get the chance.</p> <p>At the end of his speech, Ryan quoted his dad, who used to say to him, “""Son. You have a choice: You can be part of the problem, or you can be part of the solution.""</p> <p>Ryan may have helped solve some of the likeability problems facing Romney, but ultimately by trying to deceive voters about basic facts and trying to distract voters from his own record, Ryan’s speech caused a much larger problem for himself and his running mate.</p> <p>Sally Kohn joined the Fox News Channel in 2012 as a contributor.</p>",Ryan RNC Speech,0.0,0.0,"[""5"",""3""]",,Right,Lean Right,Right,True

Americans may not all be sorting through the wonky particulars, but one word everyone understands is “lie.” And yet some in the media still opt for euphemisms.</p> <p>The front page of the New York Times today reads right up top, “Ryan calls for a U.S. Turnaround, Led by Romney.” The accompanying article first addresses the plentiful contractions and outright lies in Ryan’s speech in the second paragraph, but only by noting that he said “he would stand with Mitt Romney in embarking on a generational struggle to protect the very social program — Medicare — that Democrats accuse him of trying to dismantle.” They said it, not us! The story then goes on to quote Ryan for more than ten paragraphs before calling him on another hypocritical attack, again by assuming “Democrats will be certain” to take issue with it. While a few other holes in Ryan’s speech are mentioned, his honesty is never questioned outright; the word “lie” does not appear.</p> <p>It’s also not in a subsequent fact-check article about the speech, though “lie” comes up twice in the first paragraph of a post on the Opinion blog under the headline, “Beyond Factual Dishonesty.” Presumably it doesn’t quite have the same impact there. When Times public editor Arthur Brisbane asked, “Should the Times be a truth vigilante?” the answer was apparently yes, just not right away.</p> <p>The fact-checks are everywhere today: Salon calls out Ryan for his “BS” and “brazen lies,” while the Washington Post lists “the misleading and the downright false.” The Huffington Post has a blog entry called “Paul Ryan: Lying Liar,” but even the proudly left-leaning site goes with the clunkier “Demonstrably Misleading Assertions” in its lead column on the speech.</p> <p>There’s also USA Today, NPR, AP, and CNN, none of which use the L-word. On air, the line-straddling Wolf Blitzer called Ryan’s remarks “a powerful speech” with “seven or eight points I’m sure the fact checkers will have some opportunities to dispute if they want to go forward.”</p> <p>Individuals, on the other hand, relegated to personal blogs and opinion sections, took more liberties, like Jonathan Bernstein at the Washington Post, who called out Ryan’s “staggering, staggering lie” about Obama’s debt commission. But Ryan’s falsehoods, when dissected, are not opinion, they are fact. The truth, even!

It came when he assailed President Obama for cutting Medicare — cuts that Ryan now finds unconscionable but had proposed to maintain until a few weeks ago, but never mind — for what he called “a new entitlement we didn’t even ask for.”</p> <p>This is actually true — one of the few clear truths in a speech sorely lacking them. But what does this mean?</p> <p>Obama was indeed trying to turn access to health insurance into an entitlement. Ryan and his fellow Republicans have made various gestures toward the notion of some kind of plan of their own to provide access to health insurance for people who can’t afford it, but they have never been willing to devote the necessary resources. Here was Ryan actually assailing not the method but the goal, implicitly conceding his position that health insurance is not an entitlement but a nice thing everybody would like but not everybody can have, like a beach house.</p> <p>The political logic embedded in Ryan’s formulation was even more telling. He dismissed the goal of providing health insurance to those who can’t afford it as something “we didn’t even ask for.” Who is “we”? We is the majority of Americans who do have health insurance. We outnumber the 50 million who don’t. They can go screw themselves. Ryan actually called Obama’s decision to cut what he deemed wasteful spending in Medicare to cover the uninsured his “coldest power play.” It is a cold power play to give medical care to people who can’t get it, and an act of compassion to take it away from them.</p> <p>The political blogosphere has taken apart Ryan’s brazen dishonesty brick by brick so that barely anything remains. I have been writing about his dishonesty for three years. I have the equivalent of a master’s degree in Ryan lie-ology. I’ve heard many of his lurid fantasies innumerable times and I haven’t got it in me to go through it all again — his deep dishonesty largely reflects the fundamental gap between the radicalism of his agenda and his need for public acceptance. I’ll merely point out that, even if all the smaller component dishonesties of Ryan’s speech were true, the larger points they undergirded were false as well.</p> <p>Ryan began by castigating Obama for borrowing money to fund a stimulus. He then castigated Obama for making his “first order of business” the passage of health-care reform rather than economic rescue, when Ryan himself had just told the audience that the first thing Obama had done was actually to pass a plan intended to rescue the economy. Having argued that Obama erred by distracting himself with health care rather than devote all his energies to the recovery, Ryan immediately promised he and Romney would repeal Obamacare — wouldn’t that also possibly distract from their own economic focus?</p> <p>In the same vein, Ryan told unemployed Americans, “if you’re feeling passed by, you have not failed, your leaders have failed you” — and then, moments later, sneered that Obama saw economically struggling Americans as “victims of circumstances beyond our control.” Ryan believes fervently that Obama’s failures are the sole exception to the general rule that individuals are the masters of their own economic fate. To bolster his claim that people move in and out of economic classes constantly without government intervention, Ryan described a few menial short-term jobs he had performed in his early years, boasting, “I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life” — as if, but for his own gumption and elbow grease, the heir to one of the richest families in his town was really at risk of staying in his summer lawn-mowing job forever.</p> <p>At the political level, Ryan’s notion of responsibility beggars belief. Under the Bush administration, Republicans — with Ryan’s support and often active leadership — systematically destroyed the fiscal position of the federal government. They voted for large tax cuts, a new entitlement, wars, and twice repealed pay-as-you-go budget rules that would have required them to pay for all these things. As a result, when Obama took office at the outset of the economic crisis, he inherited an annual deficit of well over a trillion dollars.</p> <p>Obama tried on numerous occasions to craft bipartisan agreements to reduce the long-term debt. Ryan, using the enormous intra-party influence he had amassed, crushed those agreements at every turn. Ryan voted against the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission, killing its prospects. To complete the dishonesty, Ryan referred to the debt commission he served on and helped kill as “they,” not “we.” (Ryan’s defenders sometimes assert that he only voted against the plan because it failed to include privatized Medicare, but in fact Ryan opposed a compromise that would do that, as well.) Ryan killed a bipartisan Senate plan and also killed a negotiated debt settlement between Obama and John Boehner.</p> <p>Part of Ryan’s logic at the time (according to two sources, one in each party) was that signing a deal “would pave the way for Mr. Obama’s easy reelection.” This was a plausible calculation — agreeing to a deficit compromise would have made it hard for Republicans to run against Obama as a left-wing spendthrift. And here was Ryan last night, running against Obama as a left-wing spendthrift, precisely as his own strategy enabled.</p> <p>Incredibly, the larger theme of Ryan’s speech was to assail Obama for failing to take full responsibilities for this state of affairs — Obama is “shifting blame,” “blaming others.” It is the single largest motif of Ryan’s speech. Let’s review: Ryan helps to create a massive structural deficit, repeatedly and almost single-handedly prevents a solution, then runs for vice-president, blaming Obama for the structural deficit and further blaming him for his unwillingness to agree that this is all his own fault.

A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said: “I believe that if our government is there to support you. this plant will be here for another hundred years.” That’s what he said in 2008. Well, as it turned out, that plant didn’t last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And that’s how it is in so many towns today, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>A lot of liberal bloggers are insisting that the plant was “shut down” under the Bush administration. There’s the point when the orders for new vehicles stopped coming in, and the point when the plant actually completed its orders and stopped making them. One was in the closing months of the Bush administration, the other was in the opening months of the Obama administration: “The Janesville plant stopped production of SUVs in 2008 and was idled in 2009 after it completed production of medium-duty trucks.”</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The plants are on “standby,” and some would dispute whether that means the factory is “lost.” But the bottom line is that people aren’t working there (other than whatever skeleton crew is sweeping the floors and maintaining the facility), they aren’t collecting pay, and they are “locked up and empty”: “Since they were shut down in 2009, both the Janesville and Tennessee plants have been on standby status, meaning they were not producing vehicles, but they were not completely shut down.”</p> <p>Some lefties are jumping up and down and saying, “But Romney and Ryan opposed the GM bailout!” Yes, but that’s not a fact at issue. Ryan doesn’t claim that he and Romney would have, or even get into the bailout.</p> <p>That section is beautifully constructed because it brings the listener to many conclusions implied but not stated: That the bailout overpromised and underdelivered, that Obama makes promises he can’t keep, and that the government is not to be relied upon to “support you.” The issue is less the GM bailout than the lack of genuine economic recovery. In the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel story quoted above:</p> <p>Auto industry observer David Cole, chairman emeritus of the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research, said it would be premature to say the Janesville plant will never reopen. “If we get back to any kind of a reasonable market, with 15- or 16 million sales, then I think that’s going to require Janesville as well,” he said. But the economy is recovering more slowly than people anticipated. “That’s really the key factor,” Cole said. “You’re going to see the company be exceedingly cautious on overcapacity. And they obviously didn’t need a commitment for Janesville to get the UAW’s support.”</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The problem for the Janesville plant isn’t the GM bailout. The problem is the national economy — the same problem that is preeminent in the minds of most voters this election.</p> <p>And that’s the biggest problem for the Obama campaign with this entire debate and all of their arguments about precisely when the GM plant stopped making cars.

It made the case against President Obama in devastating terms — using humor and memorable line after memorable line to drive home the main point that the president has been a miserable failure in office. The speech is likely to have lasting impact in this campaign.</p> <p>Which perhaps explains the panicky reaction of the mainstream press and Ryan’s liberal critics. Almost from the moment Ryan finished his speech, apologists for the president (including the Washington Post) have come out swinging, quite plainly indignant that Ryan landed so many punches when the usual media filters couldn’t stop him.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#ad#And, so, not surprisingly, these same apologists have resorted to the usual kind of smear tactics — accusing Ryan of offering up misleading arguments and even “lies.”</p> <p>These criticisms of Ryan’s speech are absurd. Everything Ryan said is factual and a fair reading of the record and prior events.</p> <p>Let’s start with Medicare. Ryan’s critics are beside themselves that the Romney campaign has effectively pinned $716 billion in Medicare cuts on the Obama administration. Two arguments are made to defend the president. First, it is said that Ryan’s own budget cut Medicare by the same amount. But the Ryan budget not only repealed all of Obamacare’s spending, it also doesn’t specify the kinds of Medicare cuts Obamacare does: It calls for the same level of savings but doesn’t spend the money elsewhere and leaves room for Congress to pursue those savings in ways that don’t rely on price controls and the elimination of benefits. Moreover, both Romney and Ryan have said that they, in a Romney administration, would meet their budgetary goals without Obamacare’s Medicare cuts by trimming elsewhere in the budget. And it is certainly the case that Romney and Ryan will have much greater flexibility than Ryan did as House Budget Committee chairman to make cuts wherever they can find them.</p> <p>Ryan’s critics also take exception to the implication that the Medicare “cuts” will do any harm to the health care provided to seniors, arguing that the savings come from “targeted cuts to providers,” not seniors. This is utter nonsense. Among the cuts in Obamacare is a deep and permanent reduction in payments to Medicare Advantage plans. According to the Medicare trustees, that cut will force 4 million seniors out of their Medicare Advantage plans. There is no question that these seniors will lose thousands of dollars per year in health benefits because of these cuts. Moreover, the chief actuary for the Medicare program has projected that, by the end of this decade, 15 percent of facilities will have to stop taking Medicare patients because of Obamacare’s cuts. That will directly impair access to care for millions of seniors, and the percentage of hospitals and nursing homes dropping out of Medicare will grow to 25 percent by 2030.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Ryan’s critics are also up in arms over his mention of the closed GM plant in Janesville, Wis. They claim that Ryan blamed President Obama for the closing of the plant — but Ryan explicitly said that the plant was already closing when then-candidate Obama came to Janesville in 2008: “We were about to lose a major factory,” Ryan said last night. Second, it is worth recalling that Obama, in a June 2008 statement, said that, if elected president, he would “lead an effort to retool plants like the GM facility in Janesville.” This is further confirmation of Ryan’s point that Obama essentially promised to find a way to keep the plant open after he became president — and did not deliver.</p> <p>But let’s step back and look at Ryan’s larger point. He was making the argument that, even with the Obama bailout, the Obama economy is so bad that the plant is still closed and, what’s worse, there’s no prospect that other vibrant industries will take its place. That’s absolutely a fair indictment of the Obama record, especially so because Obama went to the plant and promised hope and change in 2008.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#page#Then there is the business of the U.S. credit downgrade and the Bowles-Simpson commission. In his speech, Ryan properly excoriated the president for his profligate spending and for his indifference to the nation’s debt crisis. During the president’s term, the national debt will rise by more than $5 trillion. Ryan pinned S&P’s decision to lower the credit rating for debt issued by the U.S. government on the president’s failure to lead on fiscal matters, and chastised him specifically for appointing the Bowles-Simpson commission and then doing nothing with the commission’s recommendations. Ryan’s critics say he is being hypocritical because Ryan himself also opposed the Bowles-Simpson recommendations.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>But when Ryan opposed that plan (because it left in place Obamacare’s massive new entitlement spending), he proposed an alternative and passed it through the House of Representatives. What did President Obama do? Nothing. He appointed the commission to buy time during the 2010 campaign season, and then, in 2011, decided that leading on the deficit wasn’t in his political interest. So he proposed no plan of his own. And then when Ryan proposed his plan to actually head off a fiscal crisis, the president attacked it in the most partisan and demagogic terms possible. Is it any surprise, with this kind of behavior from the president, that the parties weren’t able to come to an amicable agreement? Any fair reading of the record shows that the president has abdicated his leadership responsibilities on fiscal matters. He richly deserves the blame for the downgrade.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>#ad#Finally, Ryan’s critics cannot stomach the fact that Ryan refuses to play along with their caricatures of him as an uncaring Randian, obsessed with individualism and indifferent to the needs of the vulnerable. In his speech, Ryan specifically noted that a society should be measured by how well the strong protect the weak. That’s entirely consistent with the budget plan he favors. As usual, his critics want the world to equate more governmental programs and spending with improvement in the lives of the poor. And yet, after trillions in spending, poverty and dependence are on the rise under President Obama.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Under Romney and Ryan, there will be plenty of room for generous government spending on a safety net for those who are truly incapable of taking care of themselves. That’s as it should be. But what the poor really need is opportunity, for better-paying jobs and mobility up the wage scale. There is a mountain of evidence that what will help the poor more than anything else is a vibrant free-market economy. Moreover, the reason welfare reform was such a success in 1996 was not that it limited government spending (although it did do that) but that it improved the lives of millions of lower-income American families by emphasizing work over dependence. That’s a lesson that Ryan’s critics, the president included, still have not learned.</p> <p>Paul Ryan’s acceptance speech was a tour de force, and a clear success. One measure of that success is the intensity and emptiness of the attacks coming his way. The irony is that these attacks — intended to damage Ryan by undermining his credibility — are more likely to be seen by the electorate for what they really are: desperate and dishonest tactics from those willing to say and do anything to hang on to power.</p> <p>— James C.

3cd30542-ae56-4c0e-b6b7-e6acdcbe5de7,Paul Ryan: The Happy Warrior,"Paul Ryan at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, August 29, 2012.","His conservative rallying cry is in the spirit of Kemp, Reagan, and Goldwater.",— Robert Costa is a political reporter for National Review.,"<p>Paul Ryan at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, August 29, 2012.</p> <p>His conservative rallying cry is in the spirit of Kemp, Reagan, and Goldwater.</p> <p>Tampa, Fla. — The official line is that Paul Ryan spent two weeks preparing for his speech at the Republican National Convention. In the beginning, there were late-night chats about the theme with his speechwriters, John McConnell and Matthew Scully. Later came the practice sessions at a Holiday Inn Express in his hometown of Janesville, Wis., and in the final days, there were frantic editing sessions aboard the campaign plane and inside the Marriott hotel near the Tampa Bay Times Forum.</p> <p>But according to sources close to him, Ryan rarely sweated the preparation, even though his Wednesday-night appearance before the cheering throngs of Republican delegates was, in a sense, his national introduction. To the 42-year-old congressman, who was elected to the House in 1998, the speech was always a continuation of an argument he has made since he came to Washington, two decades ago, to write speeches for his mentor, Jack Kemp, the late supply-side Congressman.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Ryan has accomplished much since he was a twentysomething aide, and his adherence to conservative principles is, evidently, as strong as ever. He took care to cite Kemp tonight, in the biggest speech of his political career, to send a message about who Paul Ryan is as a thinker — to go beyond the anecdotes about his days flipping burgers at McDonald’s or his recent efforts as chairman of the House Budget Committee.</p> <p>#ad#“As with Kemp, Paul has always been a happy warrior, and he remains a happy warrior,” says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director. “Democrats try to portray him as the austerity king, but he is a champion for growth.”</p> <p>Standing at the podium, Ryan ably weaved his biography and his political philosophy into a celebration of economic freedom and an articulation of the GOP ticket’s brand, which is a combination of competency and fiscal courage. “My dad used to say to me, ‘Son, you have a choice. You can be part of the problem or you can be part of the solution,’” Ryan said. “Mitt Romney and I have made ours: Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation’s economic problems.”</p> <p>“And I’m going to level with you: We don’t have that much time,” Ryan said, as the activists nodded. “But if we are serious, and smart, and we lead, we can do this.”</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Since Romney tapped Ryan to be his running mate earlier this month, Ryan has worn many hats on the campaign trail, from attack dog to budget expert. And Wednesday’s remarks had elements of all those roles. There were withering critiques of President Obama’s economic record and a sober discussion about federal spending. Ryan, however, worked to personalize each passage. On Capitol Hill, he often sticks to data-heavy speeches on the House floor, which win plaudits from politicos, but here, speaking to the entire country, he painted his vision with broad strokes.</p> <p>“So here we are, $16 trillion in debt and still [Obama] does nothing,” Ryan said. “They have no answer to this simple reality: We need to stop spending money we don’t have.”</p> <p>#page#Emotion was another component. Ryan’s mention of his mother’s example brought him to tears. “Mom was 50 when my dad died,” he said. “She got on a bus every weekday for years, and rode 40 miles each morning to Madison. She earned a new degree and learned new skills to start her small business. . . . And it transformed my mom from a widow in grief to a small businesswoman whose happiness wasn’t just in the past. Her work gave her hope. It made our family proud. And to this day, my mom is my role model.”</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Ryan also sought a connection with youth voters. “College graduates should not have to live out their twenties in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life,” he said.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“Paul Ryan was a shot in the arm,” says Ralph Reed, a veteran conservative activist, who appreciated Ryan’s reflections on the importance of family. “For people who aren’t familiar with everything he has done, he showed them that he is a full-spectrum conservative.”</p> <p>#ad#When he shifted to entitlements, the so-called third rail of American politics, Ryan talked again about his 78-year-old mother, who is a Florida resident and a Medicare beneficiary. And as he has on the trail, Ryan blasted Obama for using billions from Medicare funds to partially fund the federal health-care law.</p> <p>“Our opponents can consider themselves on notice,” Ryan said. “In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the Left isn’t going to work. Mitt Romney and I know the difference between protecting a program and raiding it. Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate.”</p> <p>Part of the reason for the Ryan pick, one Romney adviser says, is Ryan’s ability to make reform understandable to average voters. And so, though it wasn’t the heart of the speech, health care featured prominently.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>“Obamacare comes to more than 2,000 pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees, and fines that have no place in a free country,” Ryan said. “The president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over. That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal Obamacare.”</p> <p>Humor featured, too. Ryan mused that Romney’s music tastes are similar to the tunes that are played in hotel elevators. “My playlist starts with AC/DC and ends with Zeppelin,” he said, as the delegates chuckled.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Ryan’s speech, which was originally 4,400 words, was shortened to 3,200. Romney’s advisers wanted to make sure Ryan did not go over the television networks’ time limit.</p> <p>But the word count and the jokes were not the story. At its core, Ryan’s rousing speech was a conservative rallying cry, very much in the tradition of Kemp, Ronald Reagan, and Barry Goldwater. Those men urged Americans to shrink government and empower individuals, and Ryan did just that in the arena by the bay, and he even harkened back to Reagan’s famous “time for choosing” speech in 1964.</p> <p>“You are entitled to the clearest possible choice because the time for choosing is drawing near,” Ryan said near the end, his voice rising. “We will not try to replace our founding principles, we will reapply our founding principles. The work ahead will be hard. These times demand the best of us, all of us, but we can do this.”</p> <p>— Robert Costa is a political reporter for National Review.</p>",Ryan RNC Speech,-5.0,-5.0,"[""5"",""4""]",,Right,Right,Right,True

But by the end of the decade, the number of people without insurance coverage will have dropped from 45 million today to 30 million, the agency said in its annual update on the economic and budget outlook.</p> <p>Powered by spending cuts, higher taxes and a slowly improving economy, the federal deficit will drop to less than a half-trillion dollars next year but then begin a steady climb to more than $1 trillion a year by 2022, according to CBO projections.</p> <p>Slower recovery</p> <p>The CBO said the economic recovery from the deep recession from December 2007 to June 2009 is taking longer and won’t be as strong as previous recoveries. Analysts say the labor market’s fundamentals have shifted.</p> <p>Obamacare is one part of that because it rearranges incentives for businesses and workers.</p> <p>White House chief economic adviser Jason Furman said the health care law is about giving workers more choices. He compared it to Social Security and Medicare, which he said gave senior citizens the incentives and financial wherewithal to retire.</p> <p>In this case, he said, the CBO’s numbers show that the health care law will let younger workers make decisions about whether to remain in the workforce.</p> <p>“Maybe a spouse who wanted to be part-time so they could spend more time with their family now is able to do that,” Mr. Furman told reporters. “Somebody else who wanted to start a business and become an entrepreneur and was terrified of doing it because they’d lose their health insurance, is now able to do that too, and switch and take a chance on creating jobs and growing the overall economy. So there’s a lot of new choices that this will facilitate.”</p> <p>At the same time, Mr. Furman said he doesn’t agree with the CBO’s numbers. He argues that agency analysts didn’t take into account lower health care costs and higher worker productivity that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs a year.</p> <p>Republicans, though, used the jobs number to attack Senate Democrats seeking re-election in November.</p> <p>“This is one of the perverse incentives in this terrible law. It actually encourages able-bodied people to not work,” said Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican. “We should be doing all that we can to increase labor force participation. The health care law actually pushes it in the opposite direction.”</p> <p>Deficit progress</p> <p>Taking the budget as a whole, the CBO said Congress has made substantial headway on cutting spending and raising taxes, which will reduce the deficit to $514 billion this year and $478 billion in 2015.</p> <p>But it will rise by 2016 and steadily grow to more than $1 trillion in 2022.</p> <p>The CBO report said the economy isn’t rebounding as fast as is typical after a recession and that poor growth means less revenue for the Treasury. That means the cumulative deficit over the next decade will be $1 trillion more than projected last year.</p> <p>National debt, which is the accumulation of annual deficits, is at its highest level since the aftermath of World War II. The CBO said debt held by the public will represent 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2024, the end of the budget window.</p> <p>The report will give ammunition to those who argued that tax increases or spending cuts should have been delayed while the government pursued more economic stimulus over the past few years.</p> <p>But the CBO suggested that the problems are more structural, given the aging U.S. population and women’s participation in the labor force.</p> <p>The report said the labor market for the rest of this decade will recover more slowly than analysts predicted last year.</p> <p>The analysts said that at the deepest part of the recession, GDP was 7.5 percent below the economy’s potential output. By the end of 2013, just half of that gap had been closed, meaning the economy still has plenty of room to improve.</p> <p>“With output growing so slowly, payrolls have increased slowly as well — and the slack in the labor market that can be seen in the elevated unemployment rate and part of the reduction in the rate of labor force participation mirrors the gap between actual and potential GDP,” the CBO study said.</p>",Obamacare and Jobs,5.0,2.5,"[""5"",""4""]",,Right,Lean Right,Right,True

",A new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that budget deficits will remain low throughout this decade. Today’s budget data means Congress has no excuse for neglecting the economy or abandoning the unemployed.,"Budget deficits have fallen sharply in recent years. In fiscal year 2009, the deficit was about $1.4 trillion, equivalent to 10.1 percent of the economy as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). Now, the CBO projects a deficit for 2014 of $514 billion, which is 3.0 percent of GDP. That means as a share of GDP, this year’s deficit will be less than one-third of what it was five years ago. The CBO projects an even lower budget deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP in 2015.","Today’s CBO report shows that budget deficits are not an immediate concern. At some point, Congress will need to confront our long-term deficits, where budget projections looking several decades into the future remain concerning. Reducing long-term deficits will require many difficult choices, but the choice before Congress today could not be simpler: renew emergency unemployment benefits or abandon the workers and families who are struggling more than anyone else to make ends meet.","<p>A new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that budget deficits will remain low throughout this decade. Today’s budget data means Congress has no excuse for neglecting the economy or abandoning the unemployed.</p> <p>Budget deficits have fallen sharply in recent years. In fiscal year 2009, the deficit was about $1.4 trillion, equivalent to 10.1 percent of the economy as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). Now, the CBO projects a deficit for 2014 of $514 billion, which is 3.0 percent of GDP. That means as a share of GDP, this year’s deficit will be less than one-third of what it was five years ago. The CBO projects an even lower budget deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP in 2015.</p> <p>Unfortunately, CBO’s report also projects that total deficits over the next decade will be $1 trillion higher than they previously projected in May 2013, but the reason for this change should serve as a further wake-up call for Congress to focus on the economy. Since May 2013, CBO’s spending projections have actually fallen by $600 billion over ten years. But at the same time, tax revenue will be $1.6 trillion lower, primarily due to slower economic growth.</p> <p>Falling budget deficits in recent years may seem like good news, but this is actually the result of both positive and negative developments. On the positive side, health care costs are growing slower than expected, which saves money for federal health programs. In January 2011, the CBO projected that Medicare would cost the government $6.5 trillion from 2012 to 2021. In today’s report, it estimates that Medicare will cost $5.8 trillion over the same period, meaning about $700 billion in savings. Projected Medicaid spending is also down about $500 billion over the same period. The other good news is that paying interest on the national debt is now projected to cost much less than before. Comparing the CBO’s January 2011 report with today’s, projected interest payments from 2012 to 2021 have fallen by about $1.4 trillion.</p> <p>However, some of the deficit reduction has been the result of misguided austerity in Congress. It has repeatedly slashed sectors that are critical to getting our economy back on track, such as job training and scientific research. Had these counter-productive choices not held back the economy, 2.4 million additional jobs could have been created since 2010. If Congress does not reverse course, the outlook does not look good. With over $1 trillion in cuts projected over the next ten years, nondefense discretionary spending will fall to the lowest level ever as a share of GDP since the federal government started tracking this category of spending in 1962.</p> <p>One of the worst outcomes of Congressional austerity was allowing emergency unemployment benefits to expire for over a million Americans who have been unemployed for at least six months. Millions of unemployed workers rely on these benefits to keep their families out of poverty while they look for work. Reduced benefits also mean reduced consumer spending, which leads to fewer jobs and slower economic growth. If Congress fixes this mistake and extends emergency unemployment benefits, the CBO estimates that GDP will increase by 0.2 percent and 200,000 additional jobs will be created this year.</p> <p>Instead, Congressional Republicans are pointing to the slightly higher budget deficits that would result from extending unemployment benefits and refusing to pass an extension until Congress can agree on how to pay for it. But the latest CBO projections reveal that there is no reason for Congress to hold up unemployment benefits over deficit concerns. That’s because projected spending on unemployment benefits has already fallen substantially over the last few years. In January 2011, the CBO projected that the federal government would spend $604 billion on unemployment insurance over the next decade, which assumed that extended benefits would expire. Now it projects that the same programs will cost $525 billion over the same ten-year period. A full year extension of emergency unemployment benefits would cost $26 billion, which means Congress can pass it and still spend over $50 billion less over a decade than the program was expected to cost back in 2011.</p> <p>Today’s CBO report shows that budget deficits are not an immediate concern. At some point, Congress will need to confront our long-term deficits, where budget projections looking several decades into the future remain concerning. Reducing long-term deficits will require many difficult choices, but the choice before Congress today could not be simpler: renew emergency unemployment benefits or abandon the workers and families who are struggling more than anyone else to make ends meet.</p>",Obamacare and Jobs,-5.0,0.0,"[""5"",""3""]",,Left,Left,Left,True

So the tax benefit should change and go with them, and not be attached to their jobs. We want to address job lock. So, the key question that ought to be addressed in any health care reform legislation, is are we going to continue job lock, or are we going to allow individuals more choice, and portability to fit the 21st century workforce?” [Paul Ryan, 5/20/2009]</p> <p>— “Today, leaving a job or changing jobs means leav­ing behind the health insurance provided at the place of work. Individuals who wish to take a better job, change careers, or leave the workforce to raise a family or to retire early take substantial risks. […] Under the McCain plan, which links tax breaks directly to individuals instead of to their place of work, individuals would no longer feel obligated to stay with their employers simply because they need to keep their employer-based health insurance. [Heritage Foundation, 10/15/2008]</p> <p>— “Of course there are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I’m going to put in place…. I also want individuals to be able to buy insurance, health insurance, on their own as opposed to only being able to get it on a tax advantage basis through their company.” [Mitt Romney, 9/9/2012]</p> <p>— “[T]he employer-based system leads to ‘job lock,’ whereby people are afraid to leave their jobs if they fall ill on the job, because switching plans could mean higher premiums or denial of coverage.” [Avik Roy, former health care adviser to Mitt Romney, 2/7/2012]</p> <p>In other words, ensuring that an older person who stays in a job for its health care coverage can retire sooner or that a mother can leave her job to take care of a sick child, or an entrepreneur can can quit secure employment and start a new business have long been bipartisan goals. Democrats have sought to give Americans more options though the health care law’s exchanges and Medicaid expansion while Republican health care proposals focus on ending the favorable tax treatment of employer-sponsored health care and providing individuals with tax credits to buy their own health insurance on the individual market, across state lines.</p> <p>Academic research has quantified the cost of keeping health care coverage connected to the workplace. In 2008, researchers at Harvard estimated that there are “11 million people who would like to change jobs but are locked into their current job simply to keep their insurance,” while other studies have found that “job-to-job mobility is estimated to increase by as much as 25 percent when alternative group coverage is available.”</p> <p>As Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) explained in 2008, while rolling out the health care proposal that animated his presidential campaign, “’job lock’ reduces opportunities for American workers because they often pass up new jobs for fear of losing their health care coverage.” The health care law will start to change that predicament.</p> <p>Update:</p> <p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) who called the CBO findings “unreal” has long been an advocate of disconnecting health care insurance from employment. As he wrote in 2013, “It’s common sense to recognize that Obamacare isn’t working. We need to repeal it entirely, and instead reform federal law to expand choices and make health plans personal, portable and affordable.”</p>",Obamacare and Jobs,-5.0,-5.0,"[""5"",""4""]",,Left,Left,Left,True

If someone says, ‘I decided to retire or stay home and spend more time with my family and spend more time doing my hobby,’ they don’t feel bad about it — they feel good about it. And we don’t sympathize.

The other was the risk corridor provision in Obamacare, which they falsely call a “bailout.”</p> <p>Here’s what happened next. First, the Congressional Budget Office released its annual budget report, and, among other things, it utterly annihilated the premise that there is any such thing as an “Obamacare bailout.” Having seen their imaginary claim conclusively debunked, Republicans are now leaning toward demanding its repeal anyway:</p> <p>Breaking: GOP leadership just met... they've decided to move forward with risk corridors as top debt-limit option, will explore viability — Robert Costa (@costareports) February 4, 2014</p> <p>The Obamacare Bailout repeal plan is “gathering momentum” this morning. Tomorrow, the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee is holding a hearing entitled, “Obamacare: Why the Need for an Insurance Company Bailout?”</p> <p>The alleged bailout is actually one of three provisions in the Affordable Care Act designed to prevent insurance companies from cherry-picking healthy customers. One of them, called “risk corridors,” would impose a kind of tax on insurance companies that sign up healthier-than-expected customers, and reimburse the firms that sign up sicker-than-expected customers. (The same thing exists in the prescription-drug benefit enacted by Republicans in 2003 – the only difference is that Obamacare’s version of risk corridors only last for the first three years, while the Medicare Part D version lasts forever.)</p> <p>The Republican Party has decided that this amounts to a bailout, and has been pounding away at the theme for weeks, with major figures like Marco Rubio and Charles Krauthammer leading the way, and pretty much everybody else in the party following along.</p> <p>One obvious rejoinder to the charge is that bailout is not just a term of opprobrium you can hurl at any government program you don’t like. As Mike Konczal has explained, bailouts are a specific kind of government intervention – “these actions are special rules that go into effect only when a firm is already about to fail, and the moves are decided on a case-by-case situation (that is, bailouts are ex post and ad hoc).” If any government subsidy that prevents financial distress were a bailout, then roads would be a bailout for the auto industry and Social Security would be a bailout for bad investors.</p> <p>The bailout lingo is popular, of course, because the bailout of Wall Street, even if necessary, created justifiable animosity that conservatives are eager to transfer to other, non-bailout government programs. The distinction between bailouts and subsidies “strikes me as a semantic quibble,” argues Reason’s Peter Suderman, because risk corridors have been “transformed from the revenue-neutral risk sharing program that was originally envisioned into a mechanism for the federal government to pay off insurers.” Likewise, Ramesh Ponnuru asserts, “the exchanges as a whole will be unbalanced and in need of a taxpayer bailout.”</p> <p>Photo: Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images</p> <p>Note that they’re both assuming not only that any subsidy can be fairly called a bailout, but also that a subsidy will surely exist. The risk corridor program could end up paying more than it takes in, in which case it will wind up subsidizing insurers. Conservatives have assumed as a simple given that the risk corridors will pay out more than they take in.</p> <p>Today’s CBO report predicts just the opposite: that insurance companies will be paid $8 billion, but will pay back $16 billion. The risk corridor program is therefore predicted to result in a net expenditure of negative $8 billion. Repealing risk corridors would increase the projected deficit. If we accept the spurious equation of a subsidy with a bailout, then the Republican plan to repeal risk corridors would be a bailout, and the risk corridors would be the opposite of a bailout.</p> <p>Conservatives have assumed that of course risk corridors will pay out more to insurers, because of course the exchanges in Obamacare are failing to attract healthy customers and must be propped up. The quietest news in the CBO forecast is that there’s no evidence this is happening. Yes, the bungled health-care launch lost two months of valuable outreach time, and implanted plenty of skepticism about the new law among consumers who knew little about it beside the failed website. Right-wing intellectuals spent last fall arguing not whether Obamacare was collapsing, but whether the entire liberal project was collapsing. (Yuval Levin last November: “it looks as though we may be witnessing a failure of the administrative state on a level unimagined even by its staunchest critics.”) Only a couple weeks ago, I futilely attempted to rebut two conservatives claiming the law was already “beyond repair.”</p> <p>Today’s report projects that the bungled launch will mean enrollment in the exchanges will collapse all the way from seven million people to … six million people.

Over the course of the campaign season, Trump has proven himself a liar of Clintonian proportions, and there has never been any reason to believe that he was somehow more trustworthy when it came to his rhetorical opposition to America’s foolish immigration policies — the ostensible raison d’être for his presidential campaign, one might recall. Moreover, the fact that he is more gold-obsessed than King Midas should have suggested otherwise.</p> <p>And, indeed, this turns out not to be the first time that Donald Trump has undermined American workers to expand his profit margin. That has been his M.O. throughout his career.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>In the early 1980s, Donald Trump was a thirtysomething real-estate up-and-comer embarking on what would, for a while, be the tallest all-glass structure in Manhattan, and what remains the centerpiece of the Trump architectural empire, his Vanity of Vanities: Trump Tower, on New York City’s Fifth Avenue. According to Barbara Res, the then-31-year-old who Trump selected to oversee Trump Tower’s construction, the Donald humbly referred to Trump Tower as “The Most Important Project in the World.”</p> <p>Apparently, the first leg of the project was too important to entrust to American workers. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Federal Court, members of House Wreckers Local 95 alleged that, to avoid paying union employees their pension and welfare benefits, Trump (and the contractor he used for the job, Kaszycki & Sons) brought in some 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish the Bonwit Teller building that then occupied the site of the future Trump Tower.</p> <p>RELATED: What if Trump Doesn’t Have Billions?</p> <p>Trump denied the claims, testifying that he only found out that undocumented workers were employed on the site long after the demolition. He demurred about even having visited the site. That turned out not to be true: “Testimony established that Donald Trump visited the 57th Street site and observed Kaszycki’s Polish workers, noting that they were ‘good hard workers,’” the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York wrote in its opinion in 1991. “Workers also observed Trump visiting the job site of the Bonwit Teller demolition job.” And it’s likely that he would have been able to distinguish between union and non-union workers: “The Polish workers were obvious not only in numbers but also in appearance. In contrast to the union workers the non-union, Polish workers were distinguished by the fact that most of them did not wear hard hats. In addition the Polish workers staged several very visible work stoppages because they were not being paid their wages.”</p> <p>Trump-owned companies have tried to import 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000.</p> <p>There were other good reasons to disbelieve Trump. Daniel J. Sullivan, a labor consultant and FBI informant who had advised Trump on the demolition, testified that Trump told him about undocumented workers at the site. Meanwhile, Thomas Macari, a vice president of Trump-Equitable and its manager in charge of the demolition of the Bonwit Teller Building, was on the site regularly. According to the court opinion, Macari “was involved in every aspect of the demolition job. He knew the Polish workers were working ‘off the books,’ that they were doing demolition work, that they were non-union, that they were paid substandard wages with no overtime pay, and that they were paid irregularly if at all.” And, as if that were not enough, Macari had interacted extensively with John Szabo, an immigration lawyer representing undocumented workers who were making claims for unpaid wages. In court, Szabo testified that a “John Barron” of the Trump organization had called him in 1980 and threatened a $100 million lawsuit if Szabo did not drop the undocumented workers’ claims — and Trump admitted that he and another of his executives sometimes used “John Barron” as an alias in business dealings. (As ex post facto confirmation of Szabo’s claim, consider that a) bullying inconvenient individuals is a go-to Trump tactic, and b) his son by his third wife, Melania, is “Barron William Trump.”)</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>RELATED: The Litigious — and Bullying — Mr. Trump</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The court ruled against Trump, finding that he and Kaszycki & Sons had “knowingly participated” in a scheme to get out of paying the union what it was owed. Trump won a partial victory on appeal, when the Second Circuit overturned part of the decision and referred the rest of it for “further proceedings.” But the available facts are hard to dispute.</p> <p>#share#Some three decades later, nothing has changed. Last year, the Washington Post reported that Trump is using undocumented workers in the construction work on his much-feted project to convert Washington, D.C.’s Old Post Office Pavilion into a luxury hotel. “Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally,” the Post’s Antonio Olivo wrote in July, “before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.”</p> <p>Donald Trump is not looking out for American workers. He is looking out for his own pocketbook.</p> <p>Trump’s executive vice president and legal counsel, Michael Cohen, “said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.” (Ahem? — see above.) He then pointed the finger at the contractor Trump has employed: “Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor. That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees’ status is accurate.” Of course, if history is any indication, just because Trump is employing a contractor does not mean he is unaware of the status of at least some of the workers.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Furthermore, it’s hard to imagine that Trump is utterly in the dark about his D.C. project. He apparently has spent days “beat[ing] up some contractors” employed in the development, as he boasted on Kelly Ripa’s radio show in January of last year. And he told Pat Robertson, during a visit to Regent University earlier this week, that his daughter, Ivanka, is spearheading the project, with help from his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric (the executive vice president and executive vice president, developments and acquisitions, of the Trump Organization, respectively).</p> <p>#related#And, of course, there is Trump’s use and abuse of America’s visa programs, beyond Mar-a-Lago. Reuters reviewed Department of Labor data last August, and reports that Trump-owned companies have tried to import 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000. Jobs “that Americans won’t do” include waitress, cook, vineyard worker, golf-course superintendent, hotel manager, banquet manager, and maid. Additionally, American women apparently are not attractive enough for Donald Trump; the Trump Model Management and Trump Management Group LLC have sought to import 250 fashion models from overseas.</p> <p>Conservative voters who believe that a President Trump will enforce and strengthen our immigration laws, will prosecute those who violate them, and will put the interest of American workers first are deluding themselves. Donald Trump’s professional history is one of undermining American workers — by exploiting the law wherever possible and, when that’s not enough, breaking it outright.

Rubio reached into Trump’s closet, pulled out some grade-A skeletons, and tossed them across the stage at the University of Houston. But they won’t do the Florida senator any good if he can’t convince viewers that they’re real.</p> <p>Rubio started his onslaught by reminding America that Donald Trump once criticized Mitt Romney for going too far to the right on immigration. Romney had suggested that the government could get the undocumented to self-deport by making life in America hard for them. A tough policy to be sure, but one that doesn’t hold a candle to the Donald’s “deportation force.” Yet, in 2012, Trump called Romney’s self-deportation concept “mean-spirited” and “crazy,” and argued that it ultimately cost him the 2012 election.</p> <p>The Florida senator proceeded to call America’s attention to Trump’s hiring of guest workers at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach. On Thursday, the New York Times reported that since 2010, 300 American workers had applied for jobs at Trump’s resort. But only 17 were hired, even as the club applied for over 500 guest-worker visas.</p> <p>Then Rubio dug deep into the archives and unearthed a decades-old lawsuit that Trump settled for $1 million. His crime? Staffing a wrecking crew with undocumented Polish workers.</p> <p>Trump tried to rebut these claims as best he could — which was not very well, because all of them are true.</p> <p>On his Romney remarks, Trump claimed that he hadn’t objected to the candidate’s policy of self-deportation, only his policy of losing.</p> <p>“I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. That’s what I criticized Mitt Romney for,” Trump lied.</p> <p>On Mar-a-Lago, Trump insisted that he could not get enough American workers to staff all the seasonal jobs his resort requires during the busy season. (Many American workers who applied for jobs at Mar-a-Lago would disagree.)</p> <p>As for the Polish workers, eventually all the mogul could sputter in his own defense was, “Yeah, yeah. That was 30 years ago.” That cleared the way for the candidate formerly known as Marco Robot to improvise the best quip of the night.</p> <p>Rubio: You lied about Polish workers</p> <p>Trump: Yeah, yeah, yeah 38 years ago...</p> <p>Rubio: So there's a statute of limitations on lying? — NPR Politics (@nprpolitics) February 26, 2016</p> <p>Still, Trump never really lost his swagger.

In a world where empirical reality holds any sway over human perception, Rubio won the exchange handily. But who still believes we live in that world?</p> <p>Apparently, Marco Rubio does.

Mohammed defended Muslims who were wrongly accused in the wake of the September 11 attacks, which some conservatives suggested made him an unqualified candidate.</p> <p>Christie made clear he was “disgusted” by the “ignorance behind the criticism of Sohail Mohammed.” At an August 2011 news conference, he said:</p> <p>They are criticizing him because he is a Muslim American…I was disgusted, candidly, by some of the questions he was asked by both parties at the Senate judiciary committee…Sharia Law has nothing to do with this at all — it’s crazy! It’s crazy. The guy’s an American citizen…This Sharia Law business is crap. It’s just crazy, and I’m tired of dealing with the crazies. It’s just unnecessary to be accusing this guy of things just because of his religious background.</p> <p>Watch the video:</p> <p>Christie’s comments are inconsistent with Trump’s much-publicized proposal to ban Muslims from the United States, a proposal he’s highlighted at campaign events that have featured violence and in at least one instance the ejection of a Muslim woman for no good reason.</p> <p>But both Trump and Christie have a history of moving from relatively moderate positions to positions further right on the political spectrum. For instance, Christie once supported an assault weapons ban, but now says he supports making it easier for people to own and carry guns. Trump’s views on guns have evolved in a very similar direction.</p> <p>Both Christie and Trump went from being pro-choice to opposing abortion rights. Both were for Planned Parenthood before they were against it. (Trump acknowledges Planned Parenthood does “some very good work” but says as president he supports defunding the organization so long as they provide abortion services.)</p> <p>During his presidential campaign, Christie abandoned his support for a pathway to citizenship — a view that obviously aligns with Trump’s harsh rhetoric about immigrants. Both he and Trump have said they aren’t concerned about climate change.</p> <p>Last but perhaps not least, Christie and Trump both really, really dislike Marco Rubio.</p> <p>Christie’s endorsement of Trump comes about seven months after the governor downplayed the significance of Trump’s campaign, telling Fox and Friends that “nobody in the real world” cared about Trump’s immigration comments.</p> <p>In the same interview, however, Christie acknowledged he and Trump are longtime friends — a theme he returned to today.</p> <p>“He has been a good and loyal friend to our family,” Christie, referring to Trump, said during today’s newser.</p>",Rubio Unleashes On Trump,5.0,0.0,"[""6""]",,Right,Left,Left,False

We better get used to it.,"<p>Thursday night in Houston we met the Marco Rubio who was meant to be the most electable candidate in the Republican field.</p> <p>He was sharp, articulate, cutting, passionate and bold. And he’s been all those things before. Indeed, he was either the winner or had the second best showing as compared to Trump in the first few debates for exactly these reasons.</p> <p>But what was different on Thursday night was that Rubio showed real backbone. He knew that fresh off second place finishes he needed to make the case that not only is Donald Trump is unhinged, unprincipled and has no concrete plans, but also that he is much better equipped to be president than Ted Cruz, his chief rival.</p> <p>Cruz was certainly marginalized Thursday night. As arguably the best debater on the stage, he made very few comments that anyone will remember by the weekend. His strongest points came early on when he called Trump out for not really caring about illegal immigration since he hires illegal immigrants to build his properties and that we can’t trust Trump to nominate traditional constitutionalists to the Supreme Court because he’s supported key Democratic figures like the Clintons, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi in the past. He was also strong in his defense of Israel, drawing a start contrast with Trump who has said that he would try to be neutral in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.</p> <p>But Cruz was an afterthought Thursday evening compared to Rubio. The Florida senator relentlessly hit Trump on his inconsistencies and hypocrisy. “If Trump builds the wall [on the Mexican border] like he built Trump Tower, he'll be using illegal immigrants,” might very well be the best line of the debate and one of Rubio’s strongest points. He continually encouraged viewers to Google “Donald Trump polish workers.” Viewers who took him up on it were led to articles on Trump’s practice of hiring illegal immigrants. Rubio also pushed Trump to define his health care plan and accused him of repeating himself – “America will win again” specifically – over and over again.</p> <p>And Rubio didn’t do well by just attacking Trump. His defense of limited government, free enterprise and a strong national defense as the guiding principles of the conservative movement that he wants to be the standard bearer of was spirited and downright presidential.</p> <p>Furthermore, Rubio remains the most convincing commander-in-chief the GOP is offering. He knows his stuff and has clear plans to address all the major issues we’re facing including, but not limited to, fighting Islamic terrorism, handling North Korea and China as well as how we should be striking a balance between privacy and national security.</p> <p>That said, it’s my belief that while Rubio took advantage of his last chance to attack Trump before Super Tuesday – and that he did it very well – it won’t be enough to change the alignment of the candidates. Trump had a decent night. It wasn’t his best performance, but what’s growing increasingly clear is that it doesn’t really matter.</p> <p>More so than with any other candidate, Trump’s voters make up their minds early. They are committed to him and after big wins in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, Trump has shown that his base will turn out to vote for him even though they’re largely from groups that don’t typically vote in primaries (lower income, high school educated). And with leads in every Super Tuesday state except for Texas where Cruz is slightly ahead, there’s no reason to think that Thursday night’s debate changes the trajectory.</p> <p>As for Carson and Kasich, the debate in Houston showed that they really are running peripheral candidacies and there isn’t much reason to go on.</p> <p>Kasich would still have a good case to be a vice presidential choice without eating up votes that could go to Rubio. And it’s not altogether clear what’s motivating Carson to carry on.</p> <p>All this is to say that it’s a Trump world and the rest of the candidates are just living in it. We better get used to it.</p>",Rubio Unleashes On Trump,5.0,-2.5,"[""5"",""3""]",,Right,Lean Right,Right,True

Corinthian Colleges, which actually offered degrees and was regionally accredited, damaged far more students’ lives.</p> <p>Although 80,000 people attended Trump University’s free introductory seminars, only 9,200 paid the $1,495 for three-day seminars and as few as 800 people paid thousands of dollars for the university’s mentorship and workshop packages, according to the Washington Post. But as many as 350,000 students who borrowed to attend Corinthian Colleges’ schools could benefit from student loan forgiveness from the federal government for being victims of fraud from the college chain.</p> <p>Instead of encouraging the government to investigate the for-profit college chain, Rubio asked for leniency in a letter to the U.S. Department of Education in the summer of 2014. The letter, which was obtained by Bloomberg Politics, read, in part, “While I commend the Department’s desire to protect our nation’s students from fraudulent and malicious activity by any institution of higher education, regardless of tax status, I believe the Department can and should demonstrate leniency as long as Corinthian Colleges, Inc. continues to expeditiously and earnestly cooperate by providing the documents requested.”</p> <p>Rubio has also accepted $27,600 in contributions from Corinthian Colleges throughout the past five years, Bloomberg reported. The last donation for $2,700 was filed on April 30 of last year.</p> <p>Last year, Corinthian Colleges shut down its remaining 28 campuses, leaving 16,000 students without a college, shortly after the Department of Education fined the company $30 million for falsifying job-placement rates. For example, a student whose field of study was accounting was counted as having found a job in her field when in reality she was doing food service at Taco Bell.</p> <p>In an interview with ThinkProgress last fall, Jessica King, a 33-year-old single mother who attended Everest College and now works as a bartender, said she doesn’t think continuing her education is possible due to over $30,000 in debt she’s still paying off. “At this point, I’d love to be able to go back to school and get a degree and my finish up my hopes and my dreams, but I think Everest robbed me of that but the department of education robbed me of that,” King said.</p>",Rubio Unleashes On Trump,-2.5,5.0,"[""1"",""5""]",,Left,Left,Left,True

Security Council at the United Nations in New York, U.S., May 16, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY</p> <p>U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley revealed Monday that the U.S. had to twist China and Russia’s arms to get them on board with the new sanctions on North Korea.</p> <p>North Korea conducted two tests of an intercontinental ballistic missile in July, escalating the military threat. Prior to this test, North Korea tested several new short-, medium-, and intermediate-range missiles. Pyongyang has developed an arsenal of ballistic missiles that it can use against its neighbors and the U.S. As North Korea is close to a viable nuclear deterrent, the U.S. pushed the U.N. Security Council to act, and that required convincing China and Russia.</p> <p>The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved Resolution 2371, the “the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime” and “the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation” over the weekend, according to Haley. The resolution is expected to reduce North Korea’s $3 billion export revenue by roughly one-third.</p> <p>“The international community is standing with one voice. China didn’t pull off. Russia didn’t pull off. And all of the Security Council and the international community said that’s enough,” Haley said to Fox News’ Dana Perino Monday evening. She explained that North Korea’s repeated provocations are trying the patience of the international community. “It’s reckless. It’s irresponsible. And the international community really laid down the groundwork of saying we’re not going to watch you do this anymore.”</p> <p>North Korea responded with its usual brand of aggression in the wake of the latest round of sanctions. North Korea will “make the U.S. pay dearly for all the heinous crime it commits against the state and people of this country,” North Korean state-media warned Monday. North Korea may also be moving anti-ship cruise missiles into place along its eastern shores, according to Fox News’ Lucas Tomlinson, citing military intelligence reports.</p> <p>“They’re going to threaten, … but we’re not going to run scared from them,” Haley explained.</p> <p>In response to the growing threat from North Korea, the Pentagon is working with counterparts in Seoul to give South Korean missiles a boost. South Korea wants heavier conventional warheads for its long-range missiles to ensure that they can adequately penetrate hardened North Korean defenses at a distance.</p> <p>“Our job is to defend not just the United States, but our allies,” Haley told Fox, adding, “We have to protect our friends, and we’re going to continue to do that.”</p> <p>As for sanctions, Haley explained that the U.S. will need to stay after China to ensure that they fully implement sanctions against their nuclear neighbor. “China stepped up and said, ‘We will follow through on these sanctions’,” she told Perino, “And now we have to just stay on them to make sure they do that.”</p> <p>The North Korea problem is one that has puzzled world leaders for decades, but now that the North possesses nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of striking targets in Northeast Asia and across the vast Pacific Ocean, the situation is even more complicated. The U.S. and its allies are praying for a diplomatic solution, recognizing that any sort of military solution would be catastrophic and, in the words of Secretary of Defense James Mattis, “tragic on an unbelievable scale.”</p> <p>The challenge is that North Korea believes its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles are essential for its survival, and it has said numerous times that it is unwilling to negotiate away its weapons, especially now that it is so close to a reliable nuclear deterrent.</p> <p>Follow Ryan on Twitter</p> <p>Send tips to [email protected] dailycallernewsfoundation.org.</p> <p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

KCNA/via REUTERS</p> <p>North Korea has developed a nuclear warhead for its new intercontinental ballistic missile, a confidential defense intelligence assessment revealed.</p> <p>North Korea has successfully miniaturized nuclear bombs for warhead production, a Defense Intelligence Agency report introduced, according to the Washington Post. As for the missiles on which such a warhead might be mounted, the North has a collection of short-, medium-, intermediate-, and long-range missiles that allow it to threaten its neighbors and even the continental United States.</p> <p>“The IC [intelligence community] assesses North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles,” the assessment explains. A similar assessment out of Japan also concludes that North Korea has achieved warhead miniaturization.</p> <p>Last year, North Korean state media released images of Kim Jong-un standing next to a spherical object which some experts suspect may be the warhead North Korea plans to load onto its missiles. Whether or not that is the nuclear payload remains unclear. North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test last September, at which point it claimed that it could mount a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile, a challenging technical feat that most analysts assumed was beyond North Korea.</p> <p>Kim Jong-un claimed in January that his country was on track to test an ICBM, another obstacle that some believed North Korea would struggle to overcome. Six months later, however, the North successfully tested the Hwasong-14, which experts assess can strike targets across the continental U.S.</p> <p>Many have suggested that the North has yet to develop a reliable re-entry vehicle, claiming that the re-entry vehicle failed during the last test of North Korea’s ICBM, but there is little evidence of failure.</p> <p>For too long, the U.S. and others have been in collective denial about North Korea’s capabilities.</p> <p>The bomb that North Korea tested late last year had a substantial explosive yield around 30 kilotons, roughly twice that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan during the Second World War. The U.S., according to the latest assessment, estimates that North Korea may have as many as 60 nuclear bombs in its arsenal, much higher than initially expected.</p> <p>North Korea has made marked achievements in the advancement of its missile program over the past year.</p> <p>The Pentagon assessed last month that the North will be able to field a reliable, nuclear-armed ICBM as early as next year, two years earlier than initially expected, but North Korea may be much closer than previously thought. North Korea has an ICBM, a powerful engine, an understanding of stage separation, a nuclear warhead, and a re-entry vehicle that can likely survive its trip back through the atmosphere. North Korea may still lack the necessary guidance controls for an intercontinental strike, but the country is moving in that direction.</p> <p>With a little more tweaking and testing, the North should be able to field a nuclear-armed ICBM. “Do not be surprised when North Korea tests a staged thermonuclear weapon,” renowned arms expert Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program in the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, tweeted in response to the WaPo article.</p> <p>Follow Ryan on Twitter</p> <p>Send tips to [email protected] dailycallernewsfoundation.org.</p> <p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But she certainly is one of the reasons.”</p> <p>It's just extremely difficult for Ds to argue benefits of Nancy Pelosi's fundraising skills still outweigh cost of her presence in GOP ads. — Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) June 21, 2017</p> <p>The reasoning here appears to be: If Nancy Pelosi weren’t in the party’s leadership, then it would have been impossible for Republicans to remind Trump-averse conservatives in the Atlanta exurbs that Jon Ossoff was a Democrat — and that liberals vote for Democrats.</p> <p>It’s true that conservative groups spent a lot of money on ads tying Ossoff to Pelosi and her “San Francisco values.” And there’s no question that this culture-war theme did a lot of work for Karen Handel’s campaign: The Republican nominee refused to take a position on her party’s deeply unpopular health-care bill — while her jobs message included firm opposition to the concept that full-time workers should be paid enough money to remain alive. Handel offered her constituents little beyond an opportunity to express their disgust for Godless liberals. And this proved to be more than sufficient.</p> <p>But it just doesn’t follow that red America’s cultural resentments would lose their political potency the moment Pelosi ceded the throne. Yes, ads linked Ossoff to the minority leader — they also linked him to Kathy Griffin, black-block anarchists, and the guy that shot Steve Scalise.</p> <p>The Democrats are the party of liberals. Republicans will never have a hard time bringing this up in places where its inconveniant for Team Blue’s candidates. Nor will the party that turned a centrist technocrat into a sharia-socialist have trouble demonizing Pelosi’s successor.</p> <p>Happily, American public opinion is far more liberal than it is conservative. And there are more Democrats in the United States than there are Republicans. The problem is that the former just aren’t that into voting. And replacing Pelosi with the last surviving blue dog Democrat would only make that problem worse.</p> <p>The Democratic Party should try to convert some Republican-leaning voters — but the ones whose amygdalae flare up when they think about a liberal woman from San Francisco holding a position of power are not among them. And it’s a little insane to think otherwise. Virtually every non-Democrat who is familiar with the words Nancy Pelosi is a member of the Republican base — imagine the GOP deciding in 2016 that its path back to power involved winning over voters who gag at the mention of John Boehner.</p> <p>Now, might there be a case for replacing Pelosi, regardless of the results of last night’s election? Sure. The Democrats need to do more to cultivate their next generation of national leadership. And the party’s approval rating is roughly as high as Donald Trump’s — a rebrand couldn’t hurt. If there’s a charismatic, rising star in the House — who boasts the trust of the party’s rising left-flank, a persona that appeals to independent voters in middle America, and an apparent talent for fundraising and legislative deal-making — then by all means, Pelosi should make way for the future.</p> <p>But if that future has yet to arrive, Democrats shouldn’t pretend that it has for the sake of appealing to people who hate their party’s base.</p>",The result left President Trump and other Republicans crowing and Democrats shaking their heads.,2.5,-5.0,"[""5"",""3""]",,Left,Left,Left,True

No matter what the losing side says — and they always say this — the only thing that really matters when it comes to special elections is the ‘W’ and the ‘L.’”</p> <p>It’s certainly true that Jon Ossoff’s underperformance of the polls (he was nearly tied in the polling average, and is losing by almost 4 points) should incrementally adjust one’s view of the Democrats’ prospects. But the reason the party has lost all four special elections is glaringly simple. It is not some deep and fatal malady afflicting its messaging, platform, consultants, or ad spending allocation methods. Republicans have won the special elections because they’ve all been held in heavily Republican districts.</p> <p>The special elections exist because Donald Trump appointed Republicans in Congress to his administration, carefully selecting ones whose vacancy would not give Democrats a potential opening. It feels like Democrats somehow can’t win, but that is entirely because every contest has been held on heavily Republican turf.</p> <p>The overall measure of Democrats’ standing at the moment is not whether they have won, but how they have performed relative to the partisan composition of the districts in which they are running. That gauge remains quite positive. As Dave Wasserman points out, in the four special elections, they have overperformed the partisan baseline in their districts by an average of 8 percentage points:</p> <p>If that performance holds up in the midterm elections, it would be enough to make Democrats solid favorites to win a House majority. (The undemocratic makeup of the House map means Democrats need to increase their votes by some 6–7 percent in order to gain a majority. Of course, since the midterms don’t take place for more than a year, things could change in either direction. President Trump might change course and pass a popular domestic initiative, or benefit from a foreign crisis, or some kind of racialized conflict provoked by his draconian law-enforcement policies.</p> <p>On the other hand, Trump’s standing could well deteriorate between now and then, given that the only crises he has faced so far are ones he’s created, and his managerial prowess has not exactly inspired confidence. In 2009, Democrats not only won four straight special elections to replace departing House Democrats, they also flipped a House seats from a retiring Republican. Imagine how despondent Democrats would feel if they lost a Democratic seat with Trump in office. At the time, Democrats saw the victory as evidence that they were safe from a midterm wave. “This election represents a double blow for national Republicans and their hopes of translating this summer’s ‘tea party’ energy into victories at the ballot box,” crowed the Democrats’ House campaign chairman. As it turned out, the situation deteriorated pretty badly over the next year.</p> <p>So what accounts for the deep gloom overtaking Democrats? There are the atmospherics of repeatedly losing, which overpower any circumstantial explanation. There is also a long-standing party division over tactics, which gives all sides an incentive to play up the direness of defeat in order to emphasize their own customary remedies. (“My strategy will make our party stronger, but we’re doing fine anyway” is an argument nobody in history has ever made.) And then there is the psychology of surprise. A few months ago, a 4-point Ossoff defeat would have met expectations. After a frenzied nationalized race, it comes as a massive blow, which requires explanations large enough to bear the weight of the trauma it has inflicted upon Democrats.</p> <p>Matthew Ygelsias’s take on Ossoff’s defeat urges Democrats to change course, citing, among other models, “Jeremy Corbyn’s surprisingly strong showing.” Corbyn, of course, lost his race, just as Ossoff did. And Corbyn, unlike Ossoff, ran nationally (rather than in a heavily conservative district) and faced a deeply discredited incumbent. An average Labour nominee not encumbered by Corbyn’s left-wing baggage would probably have won a clear victory. But since Corbyn did lose by less than he had been expected to a few weeks before, momentum transmuted his narrow defeat into a galvanizing victory, just as it transmuted Ossoff’s narrow defeat into a debacle.</p> <p>The final reason for the overreaction is that everybody has priced irrationality into the system. That is, even people who know perfectly well that a swing of a few points one way or another in a single race tells very little about national conditions expect other people to overreact. It is quite possible that Handel’s victory will encourage nervous Republicans to continue holding the line for Trump’s unpopular agenda. But, to the extent the race increases the odds of Congress passing a health-care bill that polls below 20 percent, it would raise, not lower, the chance that Democrats make midterm gains. (Not that many Democrats would take that trade-off.) The irrational-response factor helps rather than hinders Democrats.</p> <p>But perhaps the better response is to take irrationality for granted, and start to act … rational?</p>",The result left President Trump and other Republicans crowing and Democrats shaking their heads.,5.0,-5.0,"[""0"",""5""]",,Left,Left,Left,True

The Democrats put so much weight on this concept that Ossoff’s campaign became the most expensive congressional bid in U.S. history. California donors and super PACs outspent every other state nine-to-one to try to flip the sixth district, only to see Ossoff actually underperforming both the polls and Clinton’s 2016 GA-06 vote to go down in a stunning defeat.</p> <p>In April, Slate branded Ossoff the pioneer of “Georgia’s progressive renaissance” — a man gearing up to answer the “existential insult of Trump.” Following Ossoff’s win in the Georgia primary, CNN’s Sally Kohn boasted that the election “damn sure was a referendum on Trump and Trump lost big league.” The Left continued to characterize the race as Ossoff versus Trump as the runoff drew nearer. Just this past weekend, the New York Times declared it would be a “high-stakes referendum on Trump,” with the “highest” stakes for Republicans.</p> <p>Yet as the votes poured in and Handel began to exceed polling and expectations, the media began to sing a different tune.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The spin began as the New York Times tweeted that “Handel averted a humiliating upset for Republicans.”</p> <p>Vox’s Matthew Yglesias, who had previously compared Ossoff’s crusade to “Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign” reflective of a “leftward shift of the Democratic Party’s message,” today decried his “bland and inoffensive” image of “just a nice guy who doesn’t like Donald Trump.”</p> <p>In a similar 180, Kohn tweeted out, “In many ways, [Handel] distanced herself from [Trump]. This is not Trump’s victory.”</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Wait, so is Ossoff basically Barack Obama or a tepid centrist? Is Handel a Trump surrogate or a Never Trumper? Most importantly, wasn’t Ossoff supposed to win with a five-point lead?</p> <p>The Democratic panic is warranted.

The group’s political-activism arm poured nearly $735,000 into the Democrat’s campaign, a contribution that was topped only by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</p> <p>After the results came in last night, Planned Parenthood immediately shifted the narrative, attempting to justify its obscene spending levels by portraying the race as some of kind of moral victory. This claim is an exercise in blatant goalpost-moving. Progressives, Planned Parenthood included, insisted throughout that Ossoff had the potential to turn Georgia blue. A loss does no such thing.</p> <p>Planned Parenthood’s activist rhetoric was clearly lacking as well. The abortion group was the campaign’s biggest purveyor of the fiction that Ossoff’s opponent, Republican Karen Handel, had intentionally deprived women of essential health care by severing ties with Planned Parenthood when she served as a vice president for the Susan G. Komen Foundation. But Handel wasn’t the instigator of that policy change; the foundation had considered it for over a decade, largely due to Komen donors’ concerns that their gifts might indirectly fund abortion.</p> <p>By tacking a $735,000 price tag onto Ossoff’s failed effort, Planned Parenthood has revealed its own futility at influencing elections. That failure underscores another important point. Planned Parenthood consistently argues that, if it were to be stripped of its federal funding, millions of women would lose “vital health care.”</p> <p>If money is really so tight over at Planned Parenthood — and if American women are truly in desperate need of life-saving care that they can’t get anywhere else — perhaps the abortion-rights group should think twice before dropping hundreds of thousands on insignificant political races, whether or not those races end in bitter defeat.</p>",The result left President Trump and other Republicans crowing and Democrats shaking their heads.,2.5,-5.0,"[""6""]",,Right,Right,Right,True

Here, on the other hand, we have a man in Donald Trump who has said that abortion is wrong. He wants to protect the unborn, and he’s committed in fact to very specific steps.”</p> <p>Fr. Pavone said his group will work to convince pro-life activists to support Mr. Trump in the general election.</p> <p>“Withholding support [from Mr. Trump] at this point is in effect support for Hillary,” he said. “Sometimes people might feel like, ‘I feel better in my conscience because I didn’t cast a vote for him and I didn’t cast a vote for Hillary either.’ [But] you can influence the election by not voting.”</p> <p>Mallory Quigley, director of communications for the Susan B. Anthony List, said her group will also support Mr. Trump, citing his campaign promise to defund Planned Parenthood and support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortions after 20 weeks of fertilization.</p> <p>“I think achieving these goals would be a huge accomplishment, bigger than any pro-life advancement that we’ve seen in our lifetime,” Ms. Quigley said, adding, “We’re expecting Trump to be a man of his word and follow through, just as he would on any issue.”</p> <p>Clarke Forsythe, acting president and senior counsel for Americans United for Life, would not commit to supporting Mr. Trump in the general election, but said supporting Mrs. Clinton — whose position on abortion he compared to the North Korea regime’s — is untenable.</p> <p>Mr. Forsythe said in a statement that AUL “will be carefully and closely watching Donald Trump between now and election day, to see whether he lays out pro-life policies as well as to learn what his recommendations will be for the GOP party platform.”</p> <p>Ms. Quigley said it is the pro-life movement’s job to support pro-life candidates — and then hold them accountable.</p> <p>For instance, after Mr. Trump praised the “wonderful things” that Planned Parenthood does besides abortion, the Susan B. Anthony List asked Mr. Trump to “take off the rose-colored glasses he wears when talking about Planned Parenthood.”</p> <p>“We’re very quick to correct Donald Trump when he’s misrepresented the movement with what he’s said,” Ms. Quigley said.</p> <p>During the GOP primary fight, pro-life groups largely supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former business executive Carly Fiorina, both of whom made defunding Planned Parenthood a central plank of their campaigns.</p> <p>Abortion opponents also questioned Mr. Trump’s history of supporting pro-choice Democrats, including Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in elections.</p> <p>But following the death of former Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Fr. Pavone said Mr. Trump is now the pro-life movement’s last, best hope of retaining a majority on the bench.</p> <p>“When it comes to the Supreme Court, Donald Trump has mentioned Scalia as a model,” he said. “Well, that’s music to our ears, naturally. We know what we’re going to get with Hillary. Even if people have doubts about what kind of people Donald Trump would nominate, the difference here is between doubt and certainty.”</p> <p>Fr. Pavone said Mr. Trump is not the ideal pro-life candidate, but added that a healthy dose of pragmatism is necessary in any election.</p> <p>“You don’t compromise on your goals or your principles,” he said. “At the same time, you look at the situation and you say, ‘How far can we go in these circumstances?’ Well, either one or the other is going to be president, so we want the better of the two.”</p> <p>“We know 100 percent where Hillary Clinton stands,” Ms. Quigley noted. “She supports abortion up until the moment of birth for any reason. She has yet to name a single instance in which she would stand in and protect the life of the child, even sex-selection abortions, abortions for disability, up until the very moment of birth.</p> <p>“We’ve made the judgment that this is what we need to do.”</p> <p>Copyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

Even the lawmakers who wrote it and the labor unions that spent liberally to help enact it are finding it a raw deal.</p> <p>Substantial parts of the law have been delayed and plenty of politically connected organizations and businesses have gotten waivers. Polls show that many Americans would like waivers or delays for themselves. This is true of independents and a significant minority of Democrats, not just Republicans. There is bipartisan support in Congress for repealing the medical devices tax and delaying the individual mandate.</p> <p>But you wouldn’t know anything about this because at the precise moment Obamacare has begun to fall apart, when it is denounced as much at an AFL-CIO convention as a meeting of Tea Party Patriots, Republicans have opted to train their fire on one another.</p> <p>No one faction is entirely to blame. Capitol Hill is filled with Republicans who would rather complain about Ted Cruz’s table manners than do anything about Obamacare. Cruz’s supporters have elevated tactical differences into theological disputes.</p> <p>The party has spent months divided between an anti-Obamacare strategy that is unworkable and an anti-Obamacare strategy that is nonexistent. No one has covered themselves in glory here. Now Republicans are running out of time to salvage even a symbolic victory of reminding the American people how out of touch the Democrats are on Obamacare.</p> <p>As the end of the fiscal year fast approaches, we are faced with two unpleasant prospects: a Republican surrender that will humiliate and enrage conservative activists or a government shutdown that will turn much of the rest of the country against Republicans, again taking the spotlight off Obamacare.</p> <p>Ever since Newt Gingrich became speaker, Republicans have developed a knack for making fiscal responsibility look irresponsible. The federal government currently piles up as much debt in a decade as it once took 200 years to amass. It took until 1987 for the federal budget to reach $1 trillion and until 1998 for the national debt to reach $5 trillion. The debt ceiling was $2.3 trillion in 1980, a number that would tank Washington’s credit rating today.</p>",GOP Fighting Obamacare,-2.5,2.5,"[""5"",""3""]",,Left,Lean Right,Right,False

National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate Doug Jones is in a death spiral, and this is their last ditch Hail Mary.</p> <p>You will notice both statements avoid addressing any specifics.</p> <p>The same goes for a fundraising appeal the judge sent out today. It did, however, raise the stakes on the allegations, attributing it not just to the lying fake-news media and the baby-killing socialists of the Democratic Party, but to Ole Lucifer and his hellish minions.</p> <p>The Obama-Clinton machine’s liberal media lapdogs have just launched the most vicious and nasty attacks against me I’ve EVER faced.</p> <p>I won’t get into the details of their filthy and sleazy attacks.</p> <p>I refuse to repeat their lies.</p> <p>The forces of evil are on the march in this country.</p> <p>We are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message.</p> <p>“Spiritual warfare” is a conservative evangelical meme that enables Christian Right folk to equate earthly opponents with demonic supernatural forces. It’s revealing that the judge and his campaign are Going There so quickly. It is very much a last resort.</p> <p>But an even more interesting religious defense of the judge was offered by Alabama state auditor Jim Ziegler, as reported by the Washington Examiner:</p> <p>“He’s clean as a hound’s tooth,” Ziegler claimed, before relying on Scripture to defend Moore.</p> <p>“Take the Bible. Zachariah and Elizabeth for instance. Zachariah was extremely old to marry Elizabeth and they became the parents of John the Baptist,” Ziegler said choosing his words carefully before invoking Christ. “Also take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.”</p> <p>Seems “national liberal organizations” aren’t the only ones trying a Hail Mary.</p> <p>When I was growing up as a Southern Baptist, the virgin birth of Jesus was one of the fundamentals taken as literal gospel truth. I don’t know that Ziegler wants to go down the road of suggesting that the behavior Moore was accused of was conducted as part of the domestic life of the Holy Family. And there is the little problem that preying on underage girls runs afoul of the laws of Alabama even if Ziegler thinks the Bible condones it, though it’s true Moore has a habit of using the latter to defy the former.</p> <p>A more lawyerly excuse was offered by Breitbart News’ Joel Pollack, suggesting three of the four allegations aren’t so bad:</p> <p>Breitbart's @joelpollak on MSNBC: ""The 16 year old and the 18 year old don't belong in that story."" — Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) November 9, 2017</p> <p>So I guess a prosecutor hitting on teenage girls — one of whom he first “approached” when she was a 14-year-old Santa’s helper at the mall — should be taken out of the equation.</p> <p>The most honest response in defense of Moore was this one from a county GOP leader in Alabama:</p> <p>After a long pause, Alabama Bibb County Republican chairman Jerry Pow tells me he'd vote for Roy Moore even if Moore did commit a sex crime against a girl.</p> <p>""I would vote for Judge Moore because I wouldn't want to vote for Doug,"" he says. ""I'm not saying I support what he did."" — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) November 9, 2017</p> <p>Charles Pierce is probably not the only observer who thinks Moore will at some point throw himself on the mercy of the good Christian people of his state:</p> <p>[I]f Moore has the sand for it, he will follow this up with an explanation of how he had sinned, as all fallen humans do, but that Jesus has forgiven him and washed him in the blood of the Lamb, and now it’s time for him to bring his redeemed hindquarters to godless Washington to show the heathen the path to glory that he’s been blessed to follow. That might work.</p> <p>With each denial of culpability and each association of his accusers with Satan, Moore is making any later tearful confession of mere sinful human failing unlikely.

Given the multiple accusations of Moore pursuing minors during that period of his life, there’s always the chance more accusers will now come forward.</p> <p>So this could well be a five-alarm political fire for the GOP in one of its strongholds. And it opens up the first realistic path for Democrats to secure control of the Senate by the end of 2018.</p> <p>Thanks to his long record of hypercontroversial statements compounded by not one but two occasions on which he lost his gavel as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for defiance of federal law, Moore was already more vulnerable than Republicans usually are in Alabama statewide races. The current RealClearPolitics polling average gives him only a six-point lead over Democrat Doug Jones. If the new allegations aren’t dispelled very quickly, Moore could be in enough trouble to convince Democrats to make a major investment in Jones, and then anything could happen.</p> <p>The emerging situation brings back memories of the Missouri Senate race in 2012, when it was widely assumed Democrat Claire McCaskill was going to lose. Then hard-right Republican Todd Akin won a complicated primary and proceeded to destroy his candidacy with ignorant and misogynistic comments suggesting rape exceptions for an abortion ban were unnecessary because “legitimate” rapes don’t cause pregnancy. For a while national and Missouri Republicans talked about substituting another candidate for the doomed Akin, but in the end they just watched him go down to defeat. Along with another favored GOP candidate who couldn’t stop saying stupid things about rape, Richard Mourdock of Indiana, Akin helped dash Republican dreams of retaking the Senate that year. And these incidents involved unfortunate words from GOP candidates. What Moore stands accused of is far worse.</p> <p>This time around, if Moore craters, reducing the GOP Senate margin to 51/49, Democrats could have a real chance of winning back the Senate next year, despite only eight Republican seats being up for reelection. Jeff Flake’s seat in Arizona and Dean Heller’s in Arizona are already highly competitive. It’s finding that third realistic target that’s been tough for Democrats. But a Jones win this year would reduce the magic number to just two.</p> <p>Yes, a Jones win is still a reach, and to regain the Senate Democrats would have to win a large number of races involving vulnerable members of their own party. But with what looks like a possible Democratic wave forming for 2018, the landscape may be shifting dramatically. What Democrats most need now to place the Senate in play is some luck, and the prospect of another oh-so-holy cultural conservative blowing up his campaign might be just what the donkey ordered.</p> <p>And if it turns out Roy Moore is guilty of what the Post story reports, he may discover that the sin the Lord most swiftly and surely punishes is self-righteousness.</p> <p>As the Post story spreads, the odds of political punishment for Moore are climbing rapidly. Mitch McConnell is saying that “[i]f these allegations are true, he must step aside.” So is Cory Gardner, chairman of the Senate Republicans’ campaign committee. John McCain is already convinced Moore should hang it up. And even Moore’s would-be Senate colleague from Alabama Richard Shelby will only say: “Let’s see how the story runs.” That’s not exactly a vote of confidence.</p> <p>But it’s not like the GOP has any lively options other than hoping Moore can somehow tough it out.</p> <p>Alabama elections division spox tells me it's ""too late"" to replace Moore on the ballot.

In his final years as Maricopa County sheriff, Arpaio had emerged as a leading opponent of illegal immigration.</p> <p>“I am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio,” the president said Sunday, during a conversation with Fox News at his club in Bedminster, N.J. “He has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. He’s a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him.”</p> <p>Trump said the pardon could happen in the next few days, should he decide to do so.</p> <p>Arpaio, 85, was convicted by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton of misdemeanor contempt of court for willfully disregarding an Arizona judge’s order in 2011 to stop the anti-immigrant traffic patrols. Arpaio had maintained the law enforcement patrols for 17 months thereafter.</p> <p>The man who built a controversial national reputation as “America’s toughest sheriff” admitted he prolonged his patrols, but insisted he did not intend to break the law because one of his former attorneys did not explain to him the full measure of restrictions contained in the court order.</p> <p>He is expected to be sentenced on Oct. 5 and could face up to six months in jail. However, since he is 85 years old and has no prior convictions, some attorneys doubt he will receive any jail time.</p> <p>'Is there anyone in local law enforcement who has done more to crack down on illegal immigration than Sheriff Joe?' - President Trump</p> <p>Citing his long service as “an outstanding sheriff,” the president said Arpaio is admired by many Arizona citizens who respected his tough-on-crime approach.</p> <p>Arpaio’s widely publicized tactics included forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and housing them in desert tent camps where temperatures often climbed well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit. He also controversially brought back chain gains, including a voluntary chain gang for women prisoners.</p> <p>Civil liberties and prisoner advocates as well as supporters of immigrants’ rights have criticized Arpaio for years, culminating in his prosecution. He lost his bid for reelection last year.</p> <p>“Is there anyone in local law enforcement who has done more to crack down on illegal immigration than Sheriff Joe?” asked Trump. “He has protected people from crimes and saved lives. He doesn’t deserve to be treated this way.”</p> <p>Stopping the flow of undocumented immigrants across the southern U.S. border was a central theme of the president’s campaign. Arpaio endorsed Trump in January 2016.</p> <p>Trump indicated he may move quickly should he decide to issue a presidential pardon. “I might do it right away, maybe early this week. I am seriously thinking about it.”</p> <p>Trump could decide to await the outcome of an appeal by Arpaio’s lawyers who contend their client’s case should have been decided by a jury, not a judge.</p> <p>In a statement after the verdict, his attorneys stated, “The judge’s verdict is contrary to what every single witness testified in the case. Arpaio believes that a jury would have found in his favor, and that it will.”</p> <p>Reached Monday for reaction to the possible pardon, Arpaio expressed surprise that Trump was aware of his legal predicament.</p> <p>“I am happy he understands the case,” he told Fox News. “I would accept the pardon because I am 100 percent not guilty.”</p> <p>The former sheriff said he will continue to be a strong supporter of the president regardless of whether he receives a pardon. But he also voiced concern that a pardon might cause problems for Trump, saying, “I would never ask him for a pardon, especially if it causes heat. I don’t want to do anything that would hurt the president.”</p> <p>Trump has not granted any pardons so far in his presidency.</p>","President Trump made a statement today regarding the events in Charlottesville, VA over the weekend in which he explicitly condemned "" the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups.""

He’s a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him.”</p> <p>Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt of court a couple of weeks ago for his serial defiance of a court order aimed at stopping his department’s eager use of racial-profiling methods. He was probably lucky he was only popped for a misdemeanor, since the racial profiling went on for years and Arpaio at one point admitted his lawyers had hired a private eye to investigate the wife of the judge he was battling. Then there’s the fact that his fight with the courts cost his county’s taxpayers well over $50 million. He could have been ordered to make restitution.</p> <p>Trump likely does sympathize with the old nativist demagogue — and not just because Arpaio was an early and avid backer of Trump’s own campaign, and a big-league fellow birther. In October of last year, candidate Trump made it clearly known he didn’t think racial profiling by cops was a problem:</p> <p>“They [police officers] see somebody that’s suspicious, they will profile,” Trump said. “Look what’s going on: Do we really have a choice? We’re trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse.”</p> <p>Perhaps that’s why Trump thinks Arpaio “has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration.”</p> <p>Given his age (he’s 85), it’s unlikely that Arpaio will draw jail time when sentencing rolls around next month. But the president seems determined to make a gesture, saying he “might [pardon Arpaio] right away, maybe early this week. I am seriously thinking about it.”</p> <p>Maybe he’ll issue the pardon to make sure his alt-right supporters don’t misunderstand today’s condemnation of racism as applying to good patriotic Americans like Arpaio. What’s racist about a little racial profiling? Latinos being pulled over for what they look like have nothing to worry about so long as they haven’t broken any laws, right?</p> <p>No, the president’s much-delayed and apparently grudging denunciation of racism today is not going to allay doubts about his ability to look at nonwhite Americans and see fellow “patriots.”</p>","President Trump made a statement today regarding the events in Charlottesville, VA over the weekend in which he explicitly condemned "" the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups.""

This morning, Trump’s only apparent expression of interest in the Charlottesville story was to blast the CEO of Merck for resigning from the president’s American Manufacturing Council to protest the White House’s moral myopia over the violence.</p> <p>But if Trump wanted to put this controversy behind him, and more generally, to address the long-term issue of his relationship with white supremacists, there’s a model available to him. Back in 1965, when conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. was running for mayor of New York, he was asked during a candidate’s debate about racist supporters, and replied:</p> <p>In case such a person does exist, I want to say something to him: “Look, buster, I don’t want your vote. You go off to the fever swamps and get yourself your own candidate, because I’m not your man.”</p> <p>This statement didn’t allay all concerns about Buckley’s and American conservatives’ willingness to oppose civil-rights laws and support candidates (like Barry Goldwater) whom racists also avidly supported. And my colleague Eric Levitz is right in saying that words alone won’t atone for many years of GOP efforts to encourage and exploit white backlash to minority progress. For Trump, a flat disavow of white supremacists now will not erase the effects of a campaign that sought to capitalize on white resentment.</p> <p>But words matter, too. And Buckley’s rebuke stands as a pretty good example of how politicians can stop being coy about despicable people in their ranks.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017</p> <p>The move, which ironically comes in the middle of the White House’s American Heroes Week, was wholly unexpected. It’s not clear why Trump decided to announce such a significant policy change via Twitter or when it would take effect. His timing in relation to other political events is also odd: He shared the news in the midst of Senate Republicans’ high-stakes fight to repeal Obamacare this week.</p> <p>Trump claims he made the move after consulting with military experts, despite the Pentagon lifting the ban on transgender service members in 2016 after an exhaustive review of its military readiness policies.</p> <p>“Our mission is to defend this country, and we don’t want barriers unrelated to a person’s qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman or Marine who can best accomplish the mission,” then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said. “We have to have access to 100% of America’s population for our all-volunteer force to be able to recruit from among them the most highly qualified — and to retain them.”</p> <p>The biggest question is what the news means for the thousands of transgender men and women currently serving in the military. There are between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender people in active military service, a Rand Corp. study estimates. Another group, the Palm Center, put the number as high as 15,500 a few years ago.</p> <p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders couldn’t give any details later Wednesday when she was asked what will happen to the transgender troops currently serving overseas or when the ban will take effect. During her daily press briefing, she repeatedly said the White House and the Defense Department will work out those specifics.</p> <p>Asked about Trump’s pledge as a candidate to fight for the LGBTQ community, Sanders said his decision to ban transgender troops was about “military readiness” and that the president “has been very clear he’s committed to fighting for all Americans.” As more questions poured in, Sanders said she would end the briefing if reporters didn’t ask about other topics.</p> <p>“If those are the only questions we have, we’re going to call it a day,” she said.</p> <p>The Pentagon has been referring all questions about the change to the White House.</p> <p>NEW: Pentagon statement on Pres Trump's transgender servicemember tweets -refers all Qs to the White House</p> <p>(h/t @ABC's @Elizabeth_McLau) pic.twitter.com/avibiD4Te3 — Karen Travers (@karentravers) July 26, 2017</p> <p>One thing that is clear is that conservatives have been gunning for this change. The right-wing Family Research Council was among the first out with a statement praising Trump for taking the step.</p> <p>“I applaud President Trump for keeping his promise to return to military priorities ― and not continue the social experimentation of the Obama era that has crippled our nation’s military,” said the group’s president, Tony Perkins. “The military can now focus its efforts on preparing to fight and win wars rather than being used to advance the Obama social agenda.”</p> <p>Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), who unsuccessfully tried to deny hormone therapy and gender transition-related care to transgender troops during debate on a defense spending bill this month, also hailed Trump for being concerned about the cost of providing care to transgender service members.</p> <p>Pleased to hear that @realDonaldTrump shares my readiness and cost concerns, & will be changing this costly and damaging policy #readiness — Rep. Vicky Hartzler (@RepHartzler) July 26, 2017</p> <p>But those costs are incredibly low: Rand Corp. estimates 30 to 140 people would seek new hormone treatments per year, and 25 to 130 would seek gender transition-related surgeries. That amounts to a 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in the Defense Department’s total health care spending, per Rand.</p> <p>The American Medical Association has emphasized the medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and gender-transition surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for people diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a “serious medical condition” that stems from the distress a person feels when his or her gender identity does not correspond with his or her birth sex. Not all transgender people are diagnosed with gender dysphoria; some don’t experience that distress.</p> <p>LGBTQ rights groups slammed Trump for making the change solely to appease his conservative base.</p> <p>“This has been studied extensively, and the consensus is clear: There are no cost or military readiness drawbacks associated with allowing trans people to fight for their country,” said Joshua Block, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project. “The president is trying to score cheap political points on the backs of military personnel who have put their lives on the line for their country.”</p> <p>Gregory Angelo, the president of Log Cabin Republicans, a group that represents LGBTQ conservatives, said Trump’s move “smacks of politics, pure and simple.”</p> <p>“The United States military already includes transgender individuals who protect our freedom day in and day out,” Angelo said. “Excommunicating transgender soldiers only weakens our readiness; it doesn’t strengthen it.”</p> <p>The president’s action completely contradicts his 2016 campaign claims about being better for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans than his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Trump dodged the draft a total of five times, once arguing he couldn’t serve in the U.S. military because of bone spurs in his heels.</p>",President Trump tweeted Wednesday that the U.S. government will not allow transgender people “to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.”,-5.0,5.0,"[""5"",""4""]",,Left,Left,Left,True

The deadline for that review was Dec. 1, 2017.</p> <p>“This is worse than don’t ask don’t tell, this is don’t serve, don’t serve,” The National Center for Transgender Equality said in a written statement. “This is an appalling attack on our service members; it is about bigotry rather than military readiness, reason or science.

Steve King, R-Iowa, said ""we don't need to be experimenting with the military. Plus there's no reason to take on that kind of financial burden.""</p> <p>But Trump himself tweeted during the campaign season that he would ""fight"" for the LGBTQ community while his opponent ""Hillary (Clinton) brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.""</p> <p>During his confirmation hearing in January, Mattis was asked whether he believed that allowing LGBT Americans to serve in the military or women in combat would undermine the military’s lethality.</p> <p>“Frankly, senator, I’ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with,” Mattis testified.</p> <p>Abbie Goldberg, professor of psychology at Clark University who has researched and written about the LGBTQ community, told Fox News “no one wins under Trump’s plan.”</p> <p>“Some people will not serve, which is a loss to the military and the country,” Goldberg said. “Others will serve, but not openly, and thus they will be at risk for discharge or verbal, physical and sexual abuse.”</p> <p>The Pentagon has refused to release any data on the number of transgender troops currently serving. A RAND study found that there are between 2,500 and 7,000 transgender service members in the active-duty military, and another 1,500 to 4,000 in the reserves.</p> <p>The study also found that allowing transgender people to serve in the military would have a ""minimal impact"" on the health care costs.</p> <p>The Pentagon announced it would “continue to work closely with the White House to address the new guidance provided by the commander in chief on transgender individuals serving in the military.”</p> <p>“We will provide revised guidance to the Department in the near future,” Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said in statement.</p> <p>Trump’s announcement comes as lawmakers on Capitol Hill debate the current practice of requiring the Pentagon to pay for medical treatment for gender transition.</p> <p>Missouri Republican Rep. Vicky Hartzler offered an amendment that would prohibit the Pentagon from spending money on transition surgeries or hormone therapy. Her amendment was narrowly defeated earlier this month.</p> <p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Trump’s decision a “cruel and arbitrary decision designed to humiliate transgender Americans.”</p> <p>“On this very day in 1948, President Harry Truman signed the executive order desegregating the U.S. military. Sixty-nine years later, President Trump has chosen this day to unleash a vile and hateful agenda that will blindside thousands of patriotic Americans already serving with honor and bravery,” she said.</p> <p>Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,slammed the sudden announcement and said anyone who is fit to serve in the military should be allowed to do so.</p> <p>“The president’s tweet this morning regarding transgender Americans in the military is yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter,” McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said.</p> <p>Transgender service members have been able to serve openly in the military since last year, when former Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the ban. Since Oct. 1, transgender troops have been able to receive medical care and start formally changing their gender identifications in the Pentagon's personnel system.</p> <p>But Carter also gave the services until July 1 to develop policies to allow people already identifying as transgender to newly join the military, if they meet physical, medical and other standards, and have been stable in their identified genders for 18 months.</p> <p>""I continue to maintain that what matters in choosing those who serve is that they are best qualified,"" Carter said in a statement. ""To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military. There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably. This action would also send the wrong signal to a younger generation thinking about military service.”</p> <p>Key concerns include whether currently enlisted troops have had medical or other issues that cause delays or problems with their ability to deploy or meet physical or other standards for their jobs. Military leaders also wanted to review how transgender troops are treated, if they're discriminated against or if they have had disciplinary problems, the officials said. They were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations publicly, so spoke on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson, Christopher Carbone and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>",President Trump tweeted Wednesday that the U.S. government will not allow transgender people “to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.”,0.0,2.5,"[""5"",""4""]",,Right,Lean Right,Right,True
