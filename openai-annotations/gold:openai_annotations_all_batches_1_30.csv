It’s important to state this clearly as possible — the statement contains no evidence of collusion with Russia to influence the presidential election. Instead, it amplifies the fact that Flynn apparently lied about contacts that were lawful and appropriate.","First, the statement says that the day after President Obama announced sanctions in response to Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 election, Flynn called a “senior official of the Presidential Transition Team (PTT)” who was with other “senior members of the PTT” at Mar-a-Lago. On the call, Flynn and the “senior official” said that they did not want Russia to “escalate the situation.” Flynn called the Russian ambassador “immediately after” his call with the senior official to communicate the incoming administration’s request. The next day, Putin announced that Russia would not retaliate against the United States, and the Russian ambassador later informed Flynn that Putin had decided not to retaliate in response to his request.","Unless Kushner has lied to the FBI about these contacts, this is not a scandal. Nothing that we’ve seen in any of the plea deals or indictments yet indicates any scheme to collude with Russia to influence the election. To be sure, we haven’t seen all the evidence (ABC reports that Flynn was instructed to contact Russia during the campaign, and we don’t yet know the substance of these contacts), but right now it looks like Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI about doing his job.",-2.5,2.5,"[""0"",""5""]",,Right,Right,True

Now, before everyone starts yelling “collusion,” the report said nothing about why Trump allegedly directed him to reach out to Russia. If it was contact for election collusion, that’s dire. I also think that’s highly unlikely. If it was contact to set the stage for post-election relations and cooperation, that’s far less problematic — unless members of the Trump administration (or Trump family) have been lying to the FBI about those contacts.

Also yesterday, Fox News reported that U.S. spy agencies detected the North Korean military “loading two anti-ship cruise missiles on a patrol boat on the country’s east coast just days ago,” suggesting another missile test may be on the way. Late last month, North Korea test-fired a missile that could hit much of the continental United States.","Unless China suddenly applies a great deal more pressure to Pyongyang, either this president or the next will face a devastating choice among bad options: accept a nuclear-armed North Korea that can strike American cities, fight a conventional war before those ballistic missiles are operational, or fight a nuclear war somewhere down the road.",-5.0,5.0,"[""5"",""4""]",,Center,Right,False

University of Texas at Austin, Abigail Fisher — who is white — argued she was denied admission to the university based on her race.","For instance, both universities and K-12 schools that have diverse student populations have lower racial bias among students, and help students build their critical thinking skills and problem-solving skills. And despite arguments that students of color can’t succeed at prestigious colleges — an argument the late Justice Antonin Scalia mentioned when the court heard the case last year — research shows the opposite: students of color actually do better the more selective the college is.",2.5,-5.0,"[""6""]",,Left,Left,True

Though this decision is a tie and will not bind future court decisions, it is, in effect, a shattering loss for the immigrants who hoped to benefit from these programs.","The plaintiffs in this case, led by the state of Texas, appear to have actively shopped around for a trial judge who is openly hostile to immigrants. That strategy has now paid off. The trial judge, Judge Andrew Hanen, issued an unusual nationwide injunction halting the new immigration programs. And a split decision in the Supreme Court is not enough to lift that injunction.","Whether they can be revived in the next presidency, moreover, will depend as much on who controls the Senate as it will on who controls the White House.

Engaging in homosexual sex IS considered by God to be sinful according to the teachings of most religions. And sin is NOT logical. Sin is deceitful, harmful and degrading to the human soul.","It seems that Robertson’s comments represent a new Chick-fil-A moment, a catalyst for conservatives to own their anti-gay beliefs and take umbrage when anybody criticizes them.

64d628b6-00bd-4669-8f8f-90295dc63cc9,"What The ‘Duck Dynasty’ Scandal Tells Us About Race, Homophobia, And The Media ","Yesterday, Phil Robertson, the star of A&E;’s massively popular reality show Duck Dynasty, about a family that made a fortune selling duck calls to hunters, followed what’s now become a familiar cycle. He was quoted saying any number of intolerant things in a profile by Drew Magary in GQ, condemned by GLAAD, and swiftly suspended by his network for an indefinite period of time. The Duck Dynasty story has gone wider than this type of cycle normally extends, with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, normally a supporter of free enterprise, complaining that Robertson’s suspension is an example of how far our society has fallen from First Amendment principles. But variations aside, the Robertson kerfuffle is the perfect scandal with which to end our year in popular culture for what it tells about the lines reality television tries — and increasingly fails — to walk, who has power to marginalize political ideas in popular culture, and how conservatives will try to defend the holdouts they’ve carved out for themselves in mass media.","The most revealing thing about Robertson’s remarks about homosexuality in GQ is really the extent to which his comments about homosexuality are on-brand for A&E.; Jase Robertson told Magary that the three things his family wanted their show to be about were “faith, betrayal of family members, and duck season.” As is clear in the profile in GQ, A&E; has tried to walk a fine line between portraying the Robertsons as religious Christians without spotlighting the parts of their beliefs that have the potential to cause precisely the kind of firestorm that resulted yesterday. “There are more things Phil would like to say — ‘controversial’ things, as he puts it to me — that don’t make the cut,” Magary writes. This dilemma of wanting part of a reality television cast member’s personality, but only the parts that will make you money, is one that faced CBS’s Big Brother this year, too, after discovering that the ways in which a number of their controversial and colorful cast members were controversial and colorful was that they were enormously ignorant racists.","It’s easy, I suppose, to dismiss the coverage of Robertson’s remarks, his suspension, and Jindal’s follow-up as all-too-predictable. But in 2013, that’s precisely why the cycle of the scandal matters. We’ve reached a point where the monetization of controversial figure as entertainment, their inevitable line-crossing, the organizations that exists to police that line-stepping, and the outrage that accompanies networks’ moderation of their own business strategies is an institution in and of itself. The relationships between all players in the cycle are symbiotic. But the power to influence culture and determine which political ideas are mass-marketable is decidedly real.",-5.0,0.0,"[""1"",""5""]",,Left,Left,True

He reportedly attended a Maryland community college to get enough credits for a high school diploma and was studying computing, but never completed the course work and later received a GED. He then enlisted in the Army in 2003 and become a security guard at a covert NSA facility at the University of Maryland. From there he leveraged his computer skills to get a job doing IT security with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), leaving in 2009 to become a private contractor serving at a variety of NSA locations — That’s the role where he became “hardened” as he watched President Obama advance “the very policies” he thought would be reined in.","However, the larger takeaway here is that as all sectors of our society have become more reliant on computer networks, system admins and IT professionals at large generally have much broader access to the information been carried across those networks than even the people directly responsible for the content flowing through the system. It’s certainly scary that the NSA wasn’t more careful about their custodial and auditing systems.

Speaking Monday to Tim Wildmon, head of the national American Family Association, Clark explained that conservatives should oppose any effort to clarify that the law does not legalize discrimination. “That could totally destroy this bill,” he explained.","Despite conservatives all asserting that RFRA is designed to allow businesses to refuse to offer products and services to same-sex couples that they offer to others, Pence continued to defend the law as not being discriminatory in a Wall Street Journal op-ed posted Monday evening.

f4be4044-b575-4a2b-bbcc-b97450329e7c,Mistakes Were Made,"Rich – That’s all fair. I don’t dispute that if we hadn’t gone to war in 2003, or if we knew then what we know now, that Saddam might well still be in power. It’s even the most likely scenario. We seized a moment, and as I said in that column , I think the pro-war side had the better argument at the time. But sometimes the better arguments turn out to be wrong when tested by reality. I subscribe to lots of might-have-been views on the war, and if it had been done right (assuming it could be), I wouldn’t have cared one whit about the WMD stuff. But the argument for toppling Saddam — from my point of view — was never that he was the greatest threat we face, but that he was the easiest target among various great threats. Iraq, obviously, has not turned out to be so easy (as a side note, I heard Ralph Peters on C-Span this morning making a very similar case). I’m a big supporter of the war on terror and I would like to think that even if we hadn’t gone to war in 2003, I would still have favored an aggressive policy toward Iraq. That means maybe we could have waited until 2004 or used proxies or done X, Y or Z.","Chait meanwhile was trying to play some kind of gotchya where he could claim that I was advocating the same position as him. My only point was that my view that the war was a mistake doesn’t necessarily require that my preference would be an Iraq with Saddam in power today. It’s possible, but certainly not my preferred position. Moreover, saying we should re-install Saddam simply isn’t remotely the same thing as saying we shouldn’t have deposed him the way we did. Just reverse it to see what I mean. If I wrote that all liberals who opposed the war really want to re-install Saddam, I’d get spammed from angry liberals for months.","Oh, one last point: Whatever I think about how we got into Iraq, the fact is we are there and a premature bug-out (er, “redeployment”) would be a disaster.",-2.5,-5.0,"[""6""]",,Right,Right,True

Rather than addressing the real problem of political committees masquerading as 501(c)(4) groups to evade public disclosure laws, this approach instead delayed the process for several groups purely on the basis of their names.","Lois Lerner, head of the IRS unit that oversees tax-exempt groups, noted that the number of 501(c)(4) group applications doubled between 2010 and 2012.

None had their status revoked or denied and the IRS apologized for the mistake.","Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, for example, told the IRS that any political ads run by the group would be “limited in amount” and “would not constitute the group’s primary purpose.” Campaign finance reform advocates have argued that, in light of more than $70 million in “independent expenditure” ad spending, the group’s primary purpose is clearly campaign activity.
