For starters, the researchers themselves acknowledge that “given the inability to determine temporal order in a single-wave cross-sectional survey, we cannot prove that belief in fake news ’caused’ these former Obama voters to defect from the Democratic candidate in 2016.” WaPo’s piece on the study is headlined “A new study suggests fake news might have won Donald Trump the 2016 election.”</p> <p>Moreover, the respondents agreed with fake statements after they voted. This carries the possibility they are simply justifying their 2016 choice.</p> <p>There is also no evidence that the fake statements or rumors used in the study were from foreign sources like Russia. Americans are perfectly capable of creating false stories on their own without outside interference.</p> <p>The researchers don’t have any evidence that these voters weren’t going to vote for Trump under any circumstances. It’s possible that many of these crossover voters felt better about their choice after learning Clinton had some sort of debilitating illness, but it’s unlikely that such a rumor would negate a voters’ policy preferences.</p> <p>A Stanford and New York University study concluded in 2017 that any so-called “fake news” stories likely had zero to minimal impact on the election’s outcome. The authors concluded:</p> <p>“If one fake news article were about as persuasive as one TV campaign ad, the fake news in our database would have changed vote shares by an amount on the order of hundredths of a percentage point. This is much smaller than Trump’s margin of victory in the pivotal states on which the outcome depended.”</p> <p>Follow Joe on Twitter.</p>","A new study suggests that fake news had a significant impact on the 2016 election, so much so that it may have given President Trump a pathway to win.

We’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.”</p> <p>Mr. Trump didn’t mention the sanctions or Russian meddling in the election, an issue that has been a sore point for the president since Democrats used it to try to question the legitimacy of his White House win. The president’s continued reluctance to call out Mr. Putin has raised eyebrows among Mr. Trump’s political foes and allies in Washington.</p> <p>British officials have been far more blunt in criticizing Russia, even as the U.S., France and Germany signed on to a letter saying there was “no plausible alternative explanation” to the nerve gas attack and calling it an assault on British sovereignty.</p> <p>The Russian government “should go away and shut up,” British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson told reporters.</p> <p>Targeting the energy grid</p> <p>The Russians hit with U.S. sanctions were involved in election meddling and cyberattacks, including what Treasury Department and national security officials said were attacks on the U.S. energy grid, aviation system and infrastructure. It was the first time the administration fingered Russia for cyberattacks that began at least two years ago.</p> <p>Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said the sanctions were part of a “broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.”</p> <p>“The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyber activity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyber-attacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,” he said in a statement.</p> <p>Moscow vowed to retaliate.</p> <p>“We have already started working on our reciprocal measures,” said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov. He didn’t elaborate on what response to expect.</p> <p>Moscow has denied involvement in the poisoning, and Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied — including directly to Mr. Trump last year — that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.</p> <p>The sanctions target the Russian spy agency FSB and Russia’s military intelligence agency GRU, as well as the Internet Research Agency, which Mr. Mueller has signaled was behind much of the cybermeddling in the presidential election.</p> <p>Treasury officials blamed the GRU and the Russian military for trying to interfere in the U.S. vote and for launching the “NotPetya” ransomware attack that wreaked havoc last year across the U.S., Europe and Asia.</p> <p>House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Edward R. Royce applauded the sanctions and said more needs to be done.</p> <p>“Russian cyberactors have been weaponizing information and targeting critical U.S. infrastructure undeterred for years,” said the California Republican. “As our midterm elections approach, we must send a clear message that attacks on our political process will not be tolerated.”</p> <p>Democrats slammed the sanctions for being too little, too late.</p> <p>“OK, it took 14 months, multiple indictments, and a poisoning in Britain … but … finally. Now we must protect our elections going forward,” tweeted Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat.</p> <p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a driving force in accusations of Trump campaign collusion with Russia, called the sanctions a “grievous disappointment.”</p> <p>He noted that only two more senior Russian officials were included and that the Obama administration had imposed sanctions in December 2016 on the others. He said it showed no new work by the Trump administration.</p> <p>“It appears that Mr. Mueller is doing more to place consequences on Russia’s behavior than the rest of the administration,” said Mr. Schiff.</p> <p>Friend or foe</p> <p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to clarify for reporters Thursday whether the White House considered Mr. Putin’s government a friend or an enemy.</p> <p>“Russia is going to have to make that determination,” she said. “They’re going to have to decide whether they want to be a good actor or a bad actor.”</p> <p>The Trump administration has punished Russia, including with sanctions, in response to its incursion into Ukraine and the forced closure of Russian outposts in San Francisco, New York and Washington.</p> <p>Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said that adding sanctions against the indicted Russians proved that Mr. Mueller’s investigation wasn’t a “witch hunt,” as the president claimed.</p> <p>“It’s more clear than ever that the president must not interfere with the special counsel’s investigation in any way,” Mr. Schumer said.</p> <p>The strained relations between the West and Russia reached a breaking point with the March 4 assassination attempt, which left the former spy, his daughter and a British police officer hospitalized with serious medical problems. Britain identified the nerve agent used as Novichok, which the Soviet military developed in the 1970s.</p> <p>Novichok is difficult to detect and it is believed to be 10 times more potent than other nerve agents such as VX and sarin.</p> <p>Mr. Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Scribal, 33, were found collapsed on a city bench in Salisbury, England, suffering from exposure to Novichok on March 4.</p> <p>In 2004, Mr. Skripal was convicted by the Russian government of spying for MI6 and accused of revealing the names of Russian agents working in the West.

To further this objective, they produced a memo that reads like talking points for one of the anti-Trump tirades that take up much of the day and night on CNN or MSNBC.</p> <p>In fact, the Intelligence Committee’s ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. – who few people had ever heard of before last year – has parlayed the endless Democratic conspiracy theories against President Trump into TV stardom. He gave 21 hours of TV interviews in 2017 to push his narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>The release of the Democratic memo was delayed because the Democrats deliberately included highly classified information that was difficult to declassify, so they could cry foul when the Trump administration refused to release this information. As a result, several sentences of the declassified memo were blacked out.</p> <p>The new Democratic memo … was part of an ongoing round-the-clock campaign to weaken President Trump, delegitimize his election, and make him look like a Russian puppet who needs to be impeached.</p> <p>Typical for a Schiff media interview, the Democratic rebuttal starts off with wild accusations against Republicans for “a transparent effort to undermine” the FBI, Justice Department, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and congressional Russia investigations.</p> <p>Among the major points of the rebuttal, the Democrats claim:</p> <p>(1) The Justice Department followed proper procedures and had compelling national security reasons for seeking a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance of Carter Page.</p> <p>(2) The FISA Court was properly informed about the partisan sponsorship of the Steele dossier, a series of memos compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>(3) The Steele dossier did not drive the FBI investigation of Page or a FISA warrant application to spy on him.</p> <p>The Democratic rebuttal tries to justify the Justice Department’s October 2016 FISA warrant application to spy on Page with sensationalistic claims that he was on the FBI’s radar for years due to his alleged contacts with Russian spies.</p> <p>The rebuttal also makes claims about Page’s interactions with Russians in mid-2016, when he reportedly was offered “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. It claims a supposed Russian-linked source told Page that Russia had thousands of Clinton’s emails that it could leak to hurt her campaign.</p> <p>However, many of Page’s alleged 2016 interactions with Russians have not been corroborated. Some come from the Steele dossier which, despite claims in the rebuttal, is still uncorroborated. Parts of the dossier have been shown to be untrue.</p> <p>The Democratic rebuttal also omits that Page had a brief, low-level role in the Trump campaign and was disparaged by a Russian intelligence officer in 2015 as “an idiot.”</p> <p>Like Schiff’s frequent TV news interviews, the rebuttal misrepresents or omits many inconvenient facts. Two of these make the entire rebuttal impossible to take seriously.</p> <p>First, the Republican memo said that Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified in a closed session in December 2017 that no warrant to spy on Page would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information. This is one of the most crucial points in the Republican memo, but the Democrats ignored it.</p> <p>Instead, the Democratic rebuttal dances around McCabe’s statement by stating that other information drove the FBI investigation. The Democratic memo says the Justice Department “provided additional information obtained through multiple corroborated sources that corroborated Steele’s reporting” in the FISA warrant application.</p> <p>This is a major omission. Either McCabe did or did not say the Steele dossier was the crucial information that drove the FISA warrant request.</p> <p>The committee’s Republicans should declassify the transcript of McCabe’s remarks to expose what is very likely a huge Democratic misrepresentation.</p> <p>Second, the Democratic rebuttal engages in verbal gymnastics to dispute Republican claims that the Justice Department failed to inform the FISA Court about the political sponsorship of the Steele dossier.</p> <p>The rebuttal tries to do this by citing a vague sentence from a footnote in the October 2016 FISA warrant request that said: “The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate 1’s [Donald Trump’s] campaign.”</p> <p>The “identified U.S. person” was Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS, a company that was paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and in turn contracted with Steele to produce the dossier critical of Trump. This was not revealed to the FISA Court.</p> <p>This gobbledygook on the FBI “speculating” that an unidentified U.S. person was seeking information to discredit the Trump campaign was designed to conceal from the FISA Court that the Steele memo was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. Incredibly, the Democratic rebuttal has no references whatsoever to the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>In fact, the footnote cited by the Democrats strengthens the Republican claim that the October FISA warrant request omitted crucial information on the veracity of the Steele dossier.</p> <p>The FISA judge obviously should have been told that a political party and a presidential campaign from one party funded a dossier to justify a FISA warrant to spy on a former member of a presidential campaign of the other political party. The Democrats’ claim that the Justice Department “accurately” informed the court about this matter is laughable.</p> <p>The highly misleading Democratic rebuttal is already having the intended effect by giving talking heads on TV news shows talking points to claim that the rebuttal disproved the Republican memo and provides evidence of collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.</p> <p>Expect Adam Schiff to be on TV as often as he can in coming days claiming his memo corrects the record. But the reality is that the Democratic rebuttal is full of the same unsubstantiated partisan claims that Schiff and other House Intelligence Committee Democrats have been making for over a year. It fails to rebut any of the serious allegations made by the committee’s Republicans.</p> <p>The bottom line: don’t believe Adam Schiff when he hawks this fake rebuttal.

A version of this piece appears in the December 31, 2017 issue of National Review.","<p>Gorsuch confirmed, ISIS defeated, taxes cut: The Trump administration has compiled a solid record of accomplishment in its first year, one that compares well with the records of many of its predecessors.</p> <p>Two of the biggest accomplishments came late in the year. The prime minister of Iraq declared victory over ISIS on December 9. Republicans reached a deal that seemed to secure passage of a tax bill on December 15. Until then, it appeared possible that 2017 would end without an all-Republican government enacting any major legislation.</p> <p>Now the Republicans’ policy record looks better, at least as most conservatives see it. The tax bill advances several longstanding conservative objectives. It cuts tax rates for most Americans, slashes the corporate-tax rate for the first time in decades, expands the tax credit for children, limits the reach of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, and scales back the tax break for expensive homes. By scaling back the deduction for state and local taxes, it may encourage a more conservative fiscal politics in the states. And it allows drilling to proceed in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p> <p>The tax bill also partly makes up for the failure of Republican efforts earlier in 2017 to repeal Obamacare. The health-care law imposes fines on people who go without insurance. The tax bill sets the fines at zero. The least popular feature of Obamacare is thus effectively nullified.</p> <p>Some conservatives would have considered voting for Trump in November 2016 worth it just for Justice Neil Gorsuch. His appointment to the Supreme Court means that Justice Scalia’s seat will remain filled by an originalist for the next few decades. If one of the Democratic appointees or Justice Anthony Kennedy leaves the Court while Republicans hold the Senate, Trump will have the opportunity to create the first conservative majority in modern constitutional history. Trump has also nominated many well-qualified conservative jurists to the appeals courts. (The quality of his district-court nominees appears to be significantly lower.)</p> <p>x</p> <p>The administration has begun to rein in regulation. It has withdrawn and modified several of the Obama administration’s regulations, often in concert with Congress. It has stopped or slowed the progress of many others that were barreling down the tracks. The Environmental Protection Agency, now run by Trump appointee Scott Pruitt, has also taken steps to end the practice of “sue and settle,” in which activist groups get the agency to adopt new policies through lawsuits.</p> <p>Trump killed President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which would have imposed significant economic costs while doing little to reduce the risks of global warming. He has effectively ended the Obama administration’s mandate that employers provide contraceptive coverage: Employers who object to providing that coverage, or providing forms of that coverage they consider to cause abortions, are to be exempt. If the new policy stands, the Little Sisters of the Poor will be spending less time in court. Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has withdrawn Obama-era regulations that led colleges to lower the burden of proof for sexual-misconduct allegations and to monitor professors’ speech.</p> <p>Conservatives of various types have thus seen progress on their agenda in 2017.</p> <p>Most conservatives cheered two symbolic actions by the administration: announcing that our embassy in Israel will move to the country’s capital city of Jerusalem and that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. (I count that planned withdrawal as symbolic because the accord did not bind us to any policy commitments.)</p> <p>Conservatives of various types have thus seen progress on their agenda in 2017. Economic conservatives got tax cuts and some deregulation. Legal conservatives got judicial appointments and an executive branch more mindful of the limits of its policymaking authority. Social conservatives also benefited from the judicial appointments and welcomed Trump’s policy of blocking international family-planning funding from going to organizations that promote or perform abortions.</p> <p>Many Republicans credit Trump for presiding over a strong economy, too. It’s a point that requires some context. Job growth has not been quite as fast as it was in Obama’s last year, but you’d expect it to slow after an expansion this long. Republican economic policies may have played a role in keeping the expansion going. Certainly the predictions of economic doom made right after the election by some Trump opponents — chiefly Paul Krugman — have not come to pass.</p> <p>It’s not the only bad outcome that has been avoided. Trump has started no trade war and has not blown up the World Trade Organization. He has merely engaged in the low-grade protectionism that is routine for presidents of both parties, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership — which may not have been able to win congressional approval even if Trump had stayed in. NATO is still standing, too, and Trump’s complaints about allies’ burden-sharing may be arresting Western Europe’s slide into functional pacifism.</p> <p>How much Trump contributed to what has gone right in 2017 is debatable. He had less influence over the shape of the tax bill than most presidents exert over major laws. His unpopularity has probably dragged down the bill’s poll numbers. The failure on Obamacare was partly his. And if we have avoided a trade war, it may because he has hired people who are undercutting him. He has reportedly complained that he wants to go further in imposing tariffs but his advisers keep thwarting him.</p> <p>People who voted for Trump in November 2016 on the theory that he would deliver policies radically different from what other Republicans would do should be disappointed. Those who voted for him because he would usually line up with conservatives and sign Republican bills, on the other hand, have reason to be pleased with his policy record.</p> <p>They may not like everything about this presidency, the effects of which will not be limited to changes in public policy. Many of Trump’s conservative supporters share some of the concerns of the majority of Americans who oppose him. These conservatives wish the president had spoken more firmly and consistently to denounce the white supremacists in Charlottesville, or had kept his distance from Roy Moore, or had contained himself on Twitter. On policy matters, though, they are getting what they wanted from him.</p> <p>— Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor of National Review.

The GSA does this as a service to all incoming presidents out of courtesy, but it neither owns the documents nor is authorized to release them to anyone under any circumstances because they are deemed entirely .</p> <p>If true, Mueller's conduct is not only unethical and improper, it constitutes lawlessness. On this basis, he must be removed and replaced.</p> <p>Counsel for the Trump Transition Team has sent a letter to Congress alleging the Fourth Amendment was violated in ""failing to obtain a warrant for the search or seizure of  property in which the owner has a reasonable expectation of privacy (Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 489).""</p> <p>Mueller might contest the claim of an unlawful seizure because the GSA  handed over the documents, but this disregards the fact that the GSA broke the law and Mueller surely knew it when he pressured the agency to do so.</p> <p>Privileged Material</p> <p>The most serious charge against Mueller is that he obtained, reviewed and used material that is .</p> <p>For months, Mueller allegedly failed to disclose to the transition team that he acquired these  documents. Under the law, he and his lawyers are not entitled to possess or read any of them. Even worse, the transition team says it warned the special counsel six months ago that it had no right to access the records without gaining permission from the PTT.</p> <p>Courts have clearly stated what prosecutors are supposed to do under these circumstances: ""An attorney who receives  documents has an ethical duty to cease review of the documents, notify the privilege holder, and return the documents."" (Arnold, 2004 U.S. Dist. Lexis 19381, at 30.)</p> <p>Did Mueller do this? Apparently not. He never notified PTT when his staff of lawyers encountered the  documents and he compounded his violation of the law by possessing and accessing them for months.</p> <p>Only the owner of such materials can waive the  that protects them. Since the GSA does not, under the law, own the records, only the transition team can make such a waiver. It did not.</p> <p>Hence, if any illegally obtained documents have been used in the Trump-Russia case, then the results are tainted and invalid. This is a well-established principle of law.</p> <p>Mueller Must Be Removed</p> <p>The use by Mueller of even one  document can, and must, result in his disqualification from the case.</p> <p>Courts have frequently used their supervisory authority to disqualify prosecutors for obtaining materials protected by the attorney-client privilege. (In re Grand Jury Proceedings John Doe #462, 757 F.2d600 Granger v Peyton, 379 F.2d 709, Arnold v. Cargill Inc., No. 01-2086, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19381.)</p> <p>Statutory law also demands Mueller's removal. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. 2635.501, government employees, including prosecutors, are directed to ""take appropriate steps to avoid an appearance of loss of impartiality in the performance of his or her official duties.""</p> <p>The lawyer for the Trump transition team states that the special counsel's office admitted in a telephone conversation on Friday that it failed to use an ""ethical wall"" or ""taint team"" to segregate any  records. This is often done to keep them isolated from lawyers and investigators involved in the case.</p> <p>Yet, Mueller did not adopt such precautionary measures. Instead, he apparently allowed his team to utilize the documents while questioning witnesses in the Trump-Russia case.</p> <p>If true, Mueller's conduct is not only unethical and improper, it constitutes lawlessness. On this basis, he must be removed and replaced.</p> <p>Given the insular nature of the special counsel operation, it is reasonable to conclude that all the lawyers and investigators likely accessed the  documents. Therefore, not just Mueller, but his entire team must be dismissed. This would include Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who oversees the case.</p> <p>Either Congress should take aggressive action or the Presidential Transition Team (now Trump for America, Inc.) must petition a federal judge to order their removal.</p> <p>The integrity of the special counsel probe has been deeply compromised by numerous allegations of corrupt acts. In its current composition, it seems beyond repair.</p> <p>The original version of this column incorrectly cited a case called ""Taylor."" The correct case name is ""Arnold.""

(That regime was, of course, Bibi Netanyahu’s.)</p> <p>More specifically: The president’s son-in-law told Flynn to call members of the U.N. national security council, and encourage them to block a resolution condemning Israel’s illegal settlements in the West Bank, in defiance of the Obama administration’s wishes.</p> <p>In making this request, Kushner (arguably) violated the Logan Act — an archaic 1799 statute that prohibits private U.S. citizens from undermining the foreign policy of a sitting U.S. president through contact with a foreign power. No American has ever been convicted of violating the Logan Act (even though a long list of people have almost certainly violated it).</p> <p>To honor Kushner’s instruction, Flynn contacted Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and asked him to impede the vote against Israel’s settlements. Shortly thereafter, Trump’s first national security adviser told the FBI that he’d never done any such thing. In saying that, Flynn (inarguably) violated the law against making false statements to federal law enforcement.</p> <p>On Friday morning, Special Counsel Robert Mueller filed documents in federal court revealing that Flynn has pleaded guilty to the crime of lying to federal agents. Those documents stated that a “a very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team” had told Flynn to implore Russia (among other UNSC nations) to block the resolution. Former members of the Trump transition team subsequently told Bloomberg, BuzzFeed, and NBC News that Kushner was that “very senior member.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that another anonymous transition official referenced in those documents — one who allegedly discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Flynn, around the time when he spoke to Kislyak — is ex–deputy national security adviser (and current nominee for ambassador to Singapore) K.T. McFarland. Shortly after Flynn departed the Trump administration last winter, the White House recruited retired vice-admiral Robert Harward to be its new national security adviser. But Harward turned down the job, after Trump (reportedly) refused to allow him to fire McFarland. At the time, journalists had difficulty understanding why the administration was willing to sacrifice Harward for McFarland’s sake.</p> <p>Fox now reporting KT McFarland was the one who told Flynn to discuss the Obama admin's Russia sanctions with Kislyak. Back in February, no one seemed to understand why the WH was willing to risk so much to keep her on. pic.twitter.com/uGfruIPaJv — Natasha Bertrand (@NatashaBertrand) December 1, 2017</p> <p>Anyhow, according to the former transition official who spoke with BuzzFeed, Flynn characterized defeating the UN resolution against Israel as a “top priority for the president”:</p> <p>“Jared called Flynn and told him you need to get on the phone to every member of the Security Council and tell them to delay the vote,” the person said.</p> <p>If confirmed, that call would bring prosecutors one step closer to Kushner, who also serves as a senior adviser to Trump.</p> <p>Kushner, the source said, told Flynn during the phone call that “this was a top priority for the president.”</p> <p>The source says Flynn took the call at the Trump transition team’s offices in the General Services Administration headquarters in northwest Washington. After hanging up, Flynn told the entire room that they’d have to start pushing to lobby against the UN vote, saying “the president wants this done ASAP.”</p> <p>In a statement Friday, Flynn denied the “false accusations” that he committed treason or “other outrageous acts” against the United States. But he admitted that he erred in lying to the FBI, before saying, “My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel’s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.”</p> <p>In his conversations with Kisylak last December, Flynn also spoke about U.S. sanctions against the Putin regime. In January, he denied having broached that subject with the Russian ambassador — and Vice-President Mike Pence vouched for that claim. Unfortunately for both of them, Kislyak was under routine surveillance by the U.S. government, and a recording of their phone call exposed his fib (eventually, the Washington Post did, too). Trump subsequently fired Flynn, supposedly for having lied to the vice-president.</p> <p>Given the severity of the accusations against Flynn, one would imagine that he provided Mueller with something more incendiary than what is currently public. Kushner’s behavior could constitute a violation of the Logan Act — but that law is widely considered a dead letter. What’s more, the Trump team’s interest in derailing the U.N. resolution was hardly a secret. The president-elect was openly undermining the sitting president’s foreign policy over Twitter. Meanwhile, the fact that Flynn lied to the FBI about his contact with Kislyak was first reported nearly a year ago.</p> <p>If this is all there is, it’s hard to see why Mueller would be so accommodating — or why President Trump would have been so preoccupied with protecting Flynn earlier this year.</p> <p>But then, the fact that Flynn ostensibly felt compelled to lie to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador — but not about conversations he had with other foreign diplomats about the resolution against Israeli settlements — is a bit eyebrow-raising.

(Reuters photo: Jonathan Ernst)</p> <p>There’s less to the news than meets the eye.</p> <p>Former Trump-administration national-security adviser Michael Flynn is expected to plead guilty today to lying to the FBI regarding his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.</p> <p>Flynn, who is reportedly cooperating with the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller, is pleading guilty in federal district court in Washington, D.C., to a one-count criminal information (which is filed by a prosecutor in cases when a defendant waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury).</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>The false-statement charge, brought under Section 1001 of the federal penal code, stems from Flynn’s conversation on December 29, 2016, with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. At the time, Flynn was slated to become the national-security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump. The conversation occurred on the same day that then-president Barack Obama announced sanctions against Russia for its interference in the 2016 election. It is believed to have been recorded by the FBI because Kislyak, as an agent of a foreign power, was subject to monitoring under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).</p> <p>Mueller has charged Flynn with falsely telling FBI agents that he did not ask the ambassador “to refrain from escalating the situation” in response to the sanctions. In being questioned by the agents on January 24, 2017, Flynn also lied when he claimed he could not recall a subsequent conversation with Kislyak, in which the ambassador told Flynn that the Putin regime had “chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of [Flynn’s] request.”</p> <p>Furthermore, a week before the sanctions were imposed, Flynn had also spoken to Kislyak, asking the ambassador to delay or defeat a vote on a pending United Nations resolution. The criminal information charges that Flynn lied to the FBI by denying both that he’d made this request and that he’d spoken afterward with Kislyak about Russia’s response to it.</p> <p>Thus, in all, four lies are specified in the one count. The potential sentence is zero to five years’ imprisonment. Assuming Flynn cooperates fully with Mueller’s investigators, there will be little, if any, jail time.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Obviously, it was wrong of Flynn to give the FBI false information; he could, after all, have simply refused to speak with the agents in the first place. That said, as I argued early this year, it remains unclear why the Obama Justice Department chose to investigate Flynn. There was nothing wrong with the incoming national-security adviser’s having meetings with foreign counterparts or discussing such matters as the sanctions in those meetings. Plus, if the FBI had FISA recordings of Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak, there was no need to ask Flynn what the conversations entailed.</p> <p>Flynn, an early backer of Donald Trump and a fierce critic of Obama’s national-security policies, was generally despised by Obama administration officials. Hence, there has always been cynical suspicion that the decision to interview him was driven by the expectation that he would provide the FBI with an account inconsistent with the recorded conversation — i.e., that Flynn was being set up for prosecution on a process crime.</p> <p>While initial reporting is portraying Flynn’s guilty plea as a major breakthrough in Mueller’s investigation of potential Trump campaign collusion with the Russian regime, I suspect the opposite is true.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>While initial reporting is portraying Flynn’s guilty plea as a major breakthrough in Mueller’s investigation of potential Trump-campaign collusion with the Russian regime, I suspect the opposite is true.</p> <p>Speculation that Flynn is now cooperating in Mueller’s investigation stirred in recent days due to reports that Flynn had pulled out of a joint defense agreement (or “common interest” arrangement) to share information with other subjects of the investigation. As an ethical matter, it is inappropriate for an attorney whose client is cooperating with the government (or having negotiations toward that end) to continue strategizing with, and having quasi-privileged communications with, other subjects of the investigation and their counsel.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Nevertheless, as I explained in connection with George Papadopoulos (who also pled guilty in Mueller’s investigation for lying to the FBI), when a prosecutor has a cooperator who was an accomplice in a major criminal scheme, the cooperator is made to plead guilty to the scheme. This is critical because it proves the existence of the scheme. In his guilty-plea allocution (the part of a plea proceeding in which the defendant admits what he did that makes him guilty), the accomplice explains the scheme and the actions taken by himself and his co-conspirators to carry it out. This goes a long way toward proving the case against all of the subjects of the investigation.</p> <p>That is not happening in Flynn’s situation. Instead, like Papadopoulos, he is being permitted to plead guilty to a mere process crime. A breaking report from ABC News indicates that Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians — initially to lay the groundwork for mutual efforts against ISIS in Syria. That, however, is exactly the sort of thing the incoming national-security adviser is supposed to do in a transition phase between administrations. If it were part of the basis for a “collusion” case arising out of Russia’s election meddling, then Flynn would not be pleading guilty to a process crime — he’d be pleading guilty to an espionage conspiracy.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Understand: If Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador had evinced the existence of a quid pro quo collusion arrangement — that the Trump administration would ease or eliminate sanctions on Russia as a payback for Russia’s cyber-espionage against the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic party — it would have been completely appropriate, even urgently necessary, for the Obama Justice Department to investigate Flynn. But if that had happened, Mueller would not be permitting Flynn to settle the case with a single count of lying to FBI agents. Instead, we would be looking at a major conspiracy indictment, and Flynn would be made to plead to far more serious offenses if he wanted a deal — cooperation in exchange for sentencing leniency.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>To the contrary, for all the furor, we have a small-potatoes plea in Flynn’s case — just as we did in Papadopoulos’s case, despite extensive “collusion” evidence. Meanwhile, the only major case Mueller has brought, against former Trump-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an associate, has nothing to do with the 2016 election. It is becoming increasingly palpable that, whatever “collusion” means, there was no actionable, conspiratorial complicity by the Trump campaign in the Kremlin’s machinations.</p> <p>READ MORE:</p> <p>The Michael Flynn Charge: Monstrous Injustice or Prelude to Bigger Things?</p> <p>The Trump Collusion Case Is Not Getting the Clinton Emails Treatment</p> <p>The Manafort Indictment: Not Much There, and a Boon for Trump</p>","Michael Flynn will reportedly testify against President Trump, saying that the then-candidate ordered him to make contact with the Russians during the election.

Alptekin arranged the meeting, which was held in New York City and was attended by Turkey’s foreign minister and energy minister.</p> <p>Former CIA director James Woolsey has claimed in interviews that the idea of kidnapping Gulen and removing him to Turkey was discussed during that meeting. Flynn and Alptekin have denied that claim, but Mueller has been said to be investigating the allegation.</p> <p>Woolsey was an unpaid adviser to Flynn’s firm at the time. He also advised the Trump campaign.</p> <p>It was also recently reported that in Dec. 2016, Flynn was offered up to $15 million to help remove Gulen from the U.S. The Turkish government has pressured the U.S. Justice and State Departments to extradite Gulen over the failed coup attempt. The U.S. agencies say they have not seen evidence to support the Turkish government’s allegations.</p> <p>Flynn will not face charges from the special counsel for his misleading statements, though he could face charges in other federal jurisdictions.</p> <p>A plea agreement that Flynn signed on Thursday states that he “will not be further prosecuted criminally by this Office for the conduct set forth in the attached Statement of Offense.”</p> <p>But the language in the agreement leaves open the possibility that Flynn could charged in other federal jurisdictions.</p> <p>“This Agreement does not bind any other United States Attorney’s Office, nor does it bind any other state, local, or federal prosecutor,” it reads.</p> <p>Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney who oversees the office in Alexandria, Virginia, where Flynn Intel was headquartered, had taken part in the Flynn probe. Boente, who abruptly announced his resignation in October, had used a federal grand jury as part of the investigation.</p> <p>The rest of the special counsel’s statement of offense against Flynn deals with his conversations with Kislyak and members of the Trump presidential transition team.</p> <p>The statement asserts that Flynn misled FBI agents during a Jan. 24 interview in which he was asked whether he discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Flynn falsely denied that he asked Kislyak to refrain from retaliating against the U.S. after the Obama administration imposed sanctions on Dec. 28 against the Russian government for hacking Democrats’ emails during the presidential campaign.</p> <p>Flynn also contacted a “senior official of the Presidential Transition Team” to develop a strategy for dealing with Kislyak, according to the statement of offense.</p> <p>Flynn and the unidentified official, who was at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, discussed “the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration’s foreign policy goals.”</p> <p>Flynn then called Kislyak and asked him not to escalate the situation and to respond in a reciprocal manner. Flynn then called the senior transition official with a briefing of the call with Kislyak. Kislyak called Flynn again on Dec. 31 informing him that there would be no retaliatory measures.</p> <p>Flynn then spoke with members of the Trump transition team about his interactions with Kislyak.</p> <p>Flynn also made false statements to the FBI about his efforts to stave off a United Nations resolution opposed by Israel.</p> <p>The statement of offense alleges that a “very senior member” of the Trump transition team directed Flynn “to contact officials from the foreign governments, including Russia” asking them to either vote against the resolution or to delay it.</p> <p>Flynn told the FBI in January “that he only asked the countries’ positions on the vote, and that he did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution.”</p> <p>Kislyak informed Flynn that Russia would not be voting against the resolution, the statement of offense reads.</p> <p>Follow Chuck on Twitter</p>","Michael Flynn will reportedly testify against President Trump, saying that the then-candidate ordered him to make contact with the Russians during the election.

It’s important to state this clearly as possible — the statement contains no evidence of collusion with Russia to influence the presidential election. Instead, it amplifies the fact that Flynn apparently lied about contacts that were lawful and appropriate.","First, the statement says that the day after President Obama announced sanctions in response to Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 election, Flynn called a “senior official of the Presidential Transition Team (PTT)” who was with other “senior members of the PTT” at Mar-a-Lago. On the call, Flynn and the “senior official” said that they did not want Russia to “escalate the situation.” Flynn called the Russian ambassador “immediately after” his call with the senior official to communicate the incoming administration’s request. The next day, Putin announced that Russia would not retaliate against the United States, and the Russian ambassador later informed Flynn that Putin had decided not to retaliate in response to his request.","Unless Kushner has lied to the FBI about these contacts, this is not a scandal. Nothing that we’ve seen in any of the plea deals or indictments yet indicates any scheme to collude with Russia to influence the election. To be sure, we haven’t seen all the evidence (ABC reports that Flynn was instructed to contact Russia during the campaign, and we don’t yet know the substance of these contacts), but right now it looks like Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI about doing his job.","<p>Moments ago, the special counsel released Michael Flynn’s “Statement of the Offense.” This document lays out Flynn’s crimes in far greater detail than the short “information” released earlier today. It’s important to state this clearly as possible — the statement contains no evidence of collusion with Russia to influence the presidential election. Instead, it amplifies the fact that Flynn apparently lied about contacts that were lawful and appropriate.</p> <p>First, the statement says that the day after President Obama announced sanctions in response to Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 election, Flynn called a “senior official of the Presidential Transition Team (PTT)” who was with other “senior members of the PTT” at Mar-a-Lago. On the call, Flynn and the “senior official” said that they did not want Russia to “escalate the situation.” Flynn called the Russian ambassador “immediately after” his call with the senior official to communicate the incoming administration’s request. The next day, Putin announced that Russia would not retaliate against the United States, and the Russian ambassador later informed Flynn that Putin had decided not to retaliate in response to his request.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Second, the statement also says that Flynn initiated contact with Russia and other foreign governments in an effort to influence a U.N. Security Council vote on an Egyptian resolution condemning Israeli settlements. Flynn made these calls at the behest of a “very senior member” of the PTT. In this instance, Flynn was unsuccessful. The Russian ambassador told Flynn that “Russia would not vote against the resolution.”</p> <p>Third, the statement briefly outlines false statements Flynn made about his relationship with the government of Turkey. These false statements appear unrelated to any dealings with Russia, in any capacity.</p> <p>While Twitter will no doubt find it “shocking” and “outrageous” that Trump transition officials were trying to influence Russian policy on matters that would directly impact the Trump presidency, there is a long history of presidential campaigns and transition teams initiating contact with foreign powers. The Trump administration — not the Obama administration — would bear the primary burden of responding to any additional Russian sanctions and the fallout from the U.N. vote. In other words, we can debate the prudence of the PTT’s actions all day long, but it was not illegal, and it was not “collusion.”</p> <p>At the same time, however, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Trump officials hid their (lawful) Russian contacts behind a smokescreen of lies. The next targets for Mueller may well be the “senior official” and the “very senior member” of the PTT. The Internet will light up with speculation about their identities — and leaks may well out them before Mueller’s ready to make his next public move — but it’s pretty clear (at least at this point) that the collusion narrative has taken a series of body blows.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>One last point — a number of folks have asked me, “If there’s no collusion, why lie about these contacts?” I can think of a number of reasons, including inexperience, hubris, and paranoia. Remember, these contacts were taking place against the backdrop of a public feeding frenzy about Trump’s Russian contacts. To admit to these contacts was to churn waters already boiling with hungry sharks. So they chose the worst possible course. They lied, and they lied when active FISA warrants meant that investigators may have immediately spotted the lies. When you start the lies, it’s hard to stop — especially when you don’t know what the FBI knows, but you do know that changes in your story will almost certainly leak to the press and create yet another firestorm.</p> <p>So, at the end of the day, we may well end up with multiple senior members of the administration facing prison time for covering up no crime and no collusion, just contacts. If that’s justice, it’s a form of justice that will leave no one standing on the political high ground and partisans on both sides seething with rage and bitterness.</p> <p>Update: Like clockwork, it looks like the “very senior member” of the PTT who asked Flynn to contact Russia about its U.N. Security Council vote has been unmasked. Bloomberg’s Eli Lake reports that it’s Jared Kushner:</p> <p>At the time, the U.N. Security Council resolution on Israeli settlements was a big deal. Even though the Obama administration had less than a month left in office, the president instructed his ambassador to the United Nations to abstain from a resolution, breaking a precedent that went back to 1980 when it came to one-sided anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N. This was the context of Kushner’s instruction to Flynn last December. One transition official at the time said Kushner called Flynn to tell him he needed to get every foreign minister or ambassador from a country on the U.N. Security Council to delay or vote against the resolution. Much of this appeared to be coordinated also with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose envoys shared their own intelligence about the Obama administration’s lobbying efforts to get member stats to support the resolution with the Trump transition team.</p> <p>Unless Kushner has lied to the FBI about these contacts, this is not a scandal. Nothing that we’ve seen in any of the plea deals or indictments yet indicates any scheme to collude with Russia to influence the election. To be sure, we haven’t seen all the evidence (ABC reports that Flynn was instructed to contact Russia during the campaign, and we don’t yet know the substance of these contacts), but right now it looks like Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI about doing his job.</p>","Michael Flynn will reportedly testify against President Trump, saying that the then-candidate ordered him to make contact with the Russians during the election.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst</p> <p>Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has been charged with making false statements to the FBI, Special Counsel Robert Mueller revealed in court documents filed on Friday.</p> <p>Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, pleaded guilty to the charges at a plea hearing in Washington, D.C. on Friday morning.</p> <p>According to the charging document against Flynn, he “willfully and knowingly” lied to FBI agents during a Jan. 24 interview in which he was asked about his conversations with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.</p> <p>Prosecutors say that Flynn lied when he said that during a Dec. 29, 2016 conversation with Kislyak, he did not ask the Russian diplomat “to refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia that same day.”</p> <p>The Obama administration had that day issued a new round of sanctions against Russia for hacking into Democrats’ emails during the presidential campaign.</p> <p>Flynn also falsely claimed that he did not recall that Kislyak told him that Russia “had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request.”</p> <p>Flynn also misrepresented a conversation he had with Kislyak on Dec. 22, 2016 about a vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution, Mueller charges. Flynn initially told FBI agents that he did not ask Kislyak to delay a vote on a resolution, and that Kislyak did not describe the Russian government’s response to the request.</p> <p>The resolution in question sought to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Russian diplomats did attempt to delay a vote on the resolution but eventually supported it. The U.S. controversially abstained from the vote instead of siding against it.</p> <p>The New York Times reported on Friday that Mueller’s team has emails showing that Flynn agreed to kill the vote on the UN resolution.

My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel’s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country,” he said.</p> <p>Ty Cobb, the White House special counsel, downplayed Flynn’s plea agreement, noting that Flynn was ousted by the Trump administration over his claims about his conversations with Kislyak.</p> <p>“The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,” said Cobb, who slyly noted that Flynn served in the Obama administration.</p> <p>“Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel’s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.”</p> <p>It is not clear whether Flynn will face any other charges from Mueller.</p> <p>Mueller’s team of investigators has been looking into Flynn’s consulting work, including for the Turkish government. Mueller’s investigators have interviewed numerous witnesses with knowledge of Flynn’s consulting work for a Turkish businessman with ties to Ankara. Grand jury proceedings in that investigation were recently delayed, sparking speculation that Flynn was working on a deal with Mueller.</p> <p>It has long been known that Flynn misled the FBI about his interactions with Kislyak. In February, just after he was fired as national security adviser, CNN reported that Flynn changed his story about his conversations with Kislyak but that the FBI did not plan to pursue charges in the case.</p> <p>CNN’s government sources said that it was not believed that Flynn intentionally misled the FBI.</p> <p>Mueller’s decision to reverse course on the Flynn case shows how aggressively he is handling the investigation.</p> <p>George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, accepted a plea deal in October for lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russians during the campaign. Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents in an interview conducted on Jan. 26, two days after FBI agents met with Flynn. He was arrested in July and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in October. As part of the deal he has been cooperating with the FBI and Mueller.</p> <p>Mueller has also issued indictments against former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates.

It should have happened years ago,” the president said when announcing the terrorist designation for Mr. Kim’s “murderous regime.”</p> <p>“The North Korean regime must be lawful,” he said. “It must end its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile development, and cease all support for international terrorism — which it is not doing.”</p> <p>North Korea is one of four countries currently slapped with the State Department’s terror designation, joining Iran, Sudan and Syria.</p> <p>The Treasury is scheduled to announce the new sanctions Tuesday. The president, who just returned from a tour of East Asian capitals seeking to put new pressure on Pyongyang over its military programs, described those measures as the “highest level” yet imposed on North Korea.</p> <p>North Korea was designated a sponsor of terrorism for two decades after it was implicated in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed 115 people. President George W. Bush removed North Korea from the list in 2008 as part of an aid-for-disarmament deal.</p> <p>“That obviously failed because we can see where we are today,” Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters in a briefing at the White House hours after Mr. Trump announced the policy shift.</p> <p>Mr. Tillerson acknowledged that the designation was mostly symbolic because of the strong sanctions that the U.S. previously led the United Nations to impose on Pyongyang. But he said the new measure would close “some of the loopholes.”</p> <p>Putting North Korea on the list has bipartisan support in Congress.</p> <p>But Jon Rainwater, executive director of the activist group Peace Action, said the designation failed to address the problem and could even make it more difficult to reach a negotiated settlement with the North short of military action.</p> <p>“Piling on sanctions, which have yet to deter or slow North Korea’s progress on its nuclear weapons program, is not the answer. We need focused, unconditional negotiations that seek to freeze and roll back North Korea’s nuclear weapons program,” he said. “This designation makes getting to the negotiating table, let alone securing an agreement, all the more difficult.”</p> <p>Trump trip</p> <p>Mr. Trump spent nearly two weeks this month traveling in Asia and building support for confronting the nuclear threat from North Korea.</p> <p>The rogue regime has test fired several missiles, including lobbing missiles over Japan. North Korea has successfully launched intercontinental ballistic missiles that are now believed capable of carrying nuclear warheads to much of the U.S. mainland.</p> <p>In making the announcement, Mr. Trump cited the regime’s assassination of Mr. Kim’s half brother, a political rival who in February was poisoned with VX nerve agent at an airport in Malaysia.</p> <p>The president also mentioned Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student held in North Korea for 17 months after being convicted of stealing a political poster. When he was returned to the U.S. in June, he had suffered severe brain damage and died a short time later. He was 22 years old.</p> <p>House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce applauded the president’s move.</p> <p>“Over the past year alone, Kim Jong-un and his regime brazenly assassinated his brother with a chemical weapon and brutally tortured Otto Warmbier, leading directly to his tragic death,” said the California Republican. “These aren’t isolated incidents, but are examples of a consistent pattern of terror.”</p> <p>He said the designation “rightly exposes the Kim regime’s utter disregard for human life and is an important step in our efforts to apply maximum diplomatic and financial pressure on Kim Jong-un.”</p> <p>Separately, a top Chinese Communist Party official wrapped up a four-day trip to North Korea on Monday after meeting with top officials and discussing the tense state of affairs on the Korean Peninsula and other issues, The Associated Press reported.</p> <p>Song Tao, the most senior Chinese official to visit Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, in two years, was officially tasked with briefing the government on China’s recent party congress, but his trip came almost immediately after President Trump visited Beijing for extensive talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, in which Mr. Trump urged Beijing to take a tougher line against its neighbor.</p>","President Trump announced that he will put North Korea back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism, calling on Kim Jong-un to relinquish its nuclear weapons programs.

According to Trump, Obama administration intelligence officials who were responsible for the assessment — like former FBI director James Comey, former CIA director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper — are “political hacks” whose opinions are apparently worth less than Putin’s.</p> <p>“Give me a break,” Trump complained to reporters, “You have Brennan, you have Clapper and you have Comey. Comey is proven now to be a liar and he is proven now to be a leaker. So you look at that and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with them.”</p> <p>Indeed, Trump seemed quite impressed by the strength of Putin’s statements, also remarking that, “He says that very strongly, he really seems to be insulted by it and he says he didn’t do it. He is very, very strong in the fact that he didn’t do it.”</p> <p>“I can’t stand there and argue with him,” Trump confessed, “I’d rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you. I’d rather have him, you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not … that whole thing was set up by the Democrats.”</p> <p>But Trump’s attempt to smear Comey, Clapper, and Brennan ignores the fact that Trump administration intelligence officials agree with their Obama administration counterparts. On Saturday, the CIA said in a statement that current CIA director Mike Pompeo “stands by” the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia attempted to influence last year’s election. This was a reiteration of Pompeo’s previous comments on the subject. Furthermore, other Trump administration intelligence officials like current Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, FBI director Christopher Wray, and NSA director Mike Rogers have agreed that Russia meddled in last year’s election.</p> <p>Putin’s meddling also came up at the first official meeting with Trump at July’s G20 summit in Germany. After that meeting, Trump said that the two would not be able to agree about the meddling and should move on. The Kremlin, meanwhile, said at the time that Trump had in fact accepted Putin’s denials — an account which has more credibility after Trump’s comments on Saturday.</p> <p>This time, Putin’s press secretary denied that the topic even came up while Putin and Trump chatted at the Asia summit, and the Kremlin said that the leaders had only discussed Syria and “confirmed their determination to defeat ISIS” in the country, per a joint statement released by Russia. As far as Putin himself, he remarked on Saturday that U.S.-Russia relations “have not come out of the crisis state yet,” but that “we are prepared to turn the page and go forward to look into the future to solve the problems that are of interest to people of the United States and people of the Russian Federation.” The ongoing Russia investigation in the U.S. is only “a manifestation of a continuing domestic political struggle,” according to Putin. On that point, Trump and Putin have always been in agreement.</p>","President Trump said that he believes Vladimir Putin's claims that he did not meddle in the 2016 election, adding that Putin is ""very insulted"" by the claims.

Fusion GPS then hired a former intelligence officer named Christopher Steele, who conducted an investigation and authored the dossier. According to the Post, the Clinton campaign and the DNC used the law firm to pay Fusion GPS right until the end of October 2016.</p> <p>As my colleague Andrew McCarthy notes, it’s a clever arrangement. The use of the law firm adds a layer of deniability, and when controversy arises, Fusion GPS is able to appeal to attorney-client privilege to shield itself from scrutiny.</p> <p>It would be easy, at this point, to start to wander down the rabbit hole, to wonder how much of the so-called “Russia controversy” is based on the Clinton campaign’s opposition research, but let’s not speculate. The truth will emerge. Instead, let’s do something else: Let’s consider how the Russian-dossier story has thus far represented a perfect storm of classic Clintonism, media irresponsibility, and Democratic moral blindness.</p> <p>First, the Clintonism. The New York Times’s Maggie Haberman responded to the Post story with a perfect tweet:</p> <p>Folks involved in funding this lied about it, and with sanctimony, for a year https://t.co/vXKRV1wRJc — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) October 24, 2017</p> <p>“Sanctimonious lying” is Clintonworld’s M.O. From Bill to Hillary to key members of her team, they lie constantly, repetitively, and with style, and the lies often conceal no-holds-barred, bare-knuckle politics designed to win races and destroy political opponents.</p> <p>The lies here are important. It’s one thing to review a dossier compiled by a “former intelligence agent” and consider its contents as the product of an objective process. It’s another thing entirely to review that same work as the direct product of an opposing campaign’s opposition research. The goal of an opposition researcher is to collect everything and share everything with the client. A proper intelligence analysis, however, involves separating truth from fiction and provable claims from unverifiable allegations.</p> <p>Those who pitched the Russian dossier treated it not as opposition research but rather as a form of intelligence report. It had distinctive formatting. It used terms of art. It looked like a government document. How many people did it fool?</p> <p>Then there’s the media irresponsibility. There are reasons why news outlets don’t simply publish partisan opposition-research files: they’re full of rumor, innuendo, and sometimes outright lies. Campaigns routinely keep gigabytes of information about political opponents, and those files can contain the most fantastical of allegations. Yes, there are often true allegations alongside the scurrilous ones, but responsible journalists research those allegations before publishing them. Responsible journalists know to treat dirt from opposing campaigns with special skepticism. They don’t simply take a campaign’s work, upload it to their servers, and press “publish.”</p> <p>It was shameful for BuzzFeed to publish the dossier then. It’s even more shameful now.</p> <p>Yet that’s exactly what BuzzFeed did when it published the dossier in January. We knew then that it was the product of Trump opponents. (After all, which Trump friend would commission such a report?) We did not know it was the product of the Clinton campaign. A news outlet took a rumor-filled document of then-unknown origin, failed to verify its claims, and published it anyway. At the time, BuzzFeed called its work “ferocious reporting,” but anyone can publish an opposition-research file. It was shameful for BuzzFeed to publish the dossier then. It’s even more shameful now.</p> <p>Finally, let’s talk for a moment about Democratic moral blindness. One of the more incredible aspects of the emerging post-election narrative is the hero-worship that greets Hillary in some progressive circles. Sure, there are Bernie Bros and others who are bitterly angry at her, but others greet her with hugs, cheers, and tears.</p> <p>This is absurd. It’s as if some Democrats see the 2016 election as a Lord of the Rings–style struggle of good versus evil, Frodo battling Gollum at the Cracks of Doom, only to see Gollum win. Nope, sorry. This was Gollum versus Gollum from the word go. The two most dishonest and disliked politicians in America battled in the sewers of American politics, and heroes were hard to find. I’m sorry, Democrats. You know how I feel about Trump, but lies and slander about Hillary are no more virtuous than lies and slander about Trump.</p> <p>We don’t know what role the Russia dossier has played or is playing in the Russia investigation. We don’t know yet which parts (if any) are true. Indeed, when it comes to the full extent of Russian efforts to sow chaos in our election, influence the Clintons, or influence the Trumps, we’re like the proverbial blind men feeling different parts of the elephant. We know so little.

He has no military background or anything like that.”","<p>Photo: David Becker/Getty Images</p> <p>A gunman opened fire on a crowd at a country-music concert in Las Nevada, Nevada, on Sunday night, killing at least 58 people and injuring more than 500 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.</p> <p>Amid the horrific rituals that accompany large-scale massacres, which punctuate American life more often than they used to, there were some details about the alleged murderer, Stephen Paddock, that immediately stood out. One was his age: At 64 years old, Paddock was much older than the average perpetrator of mass shootings.</p> <p>The second was the weapon he reportedly chose to carry out his massacre.</p> <p>Many experts speculated that Paddock used a fully automatic rifle, a highly unusual weapon for a civilian to obtain.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday afternoon that 18 to 20 guns, some of them automatic, were found in Paddock’s hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, from which he fired into the crowd. The New York Times reports that among the weapons were also AR-15s, which are semi-automatic. Paddock reportedly smashed two windows in his room, and set up two scoped rifles with tripods to shoot out of them.</p> <p>Fully automatic rifles, which have been common in warfare since World War I, allow the shooter to shoot nonstop, with no need to keep pulling the trigger. (They are similar to, but can differ subtly from, machine guns.) In disturbing video clips of last night’s shooting, a nonstop patter of gunfire can be heard coming from the hotel, followed by periods of silence. The pattern led analysts to believe that Paddock was using (and repeatedly reloading) an automatic rifle.</p> <p>It’s also possible that Paddock modified one or more semiautomatic rifles to fire automatically, in a process known as “bump,” or “slide fire” — though doing so reliably is difficult because the guns often overheat. And some experts said the firing heard in the audio was too rapid to have come from a modified rifle.</p> <p>Semiautomatic rifles force the user to pull the trigger every time they want to fire a single shot. Such guns, particularly the AR-15 rifle — which is a modified version of the M16 military assault rifle — have become the weapon of choice in many American massacres in recent years, including in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and San Bernardino, California, in 2015.</p> <p>Such rifles are easily obtained in many U.S. states, including Nevada. But automatic rifles have been banned for civilian purchase since 1986, when Congress passed the Firearms Owners’ Protection Act, which made it easier for Americans to buy many kinds of firearms, but nevertheless prohibited the manufacture of fully automatic rifles. (The NRA’s Wayne LaPierre actually advocated for that provision, which seems unimaginable now.) Automatic rifles manufactured before 1986 must be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, a cumbersome process.</p> <p>Even before that, the 1934 National Firearms Act, which was passed in the wake of Prohibition-era gangland violence, imposed severe restrictions on purchasing and handling automatic rifles, which involved harsh taxes and fingerprinting. Sales of the guns plummeted after the passage of that law, and their use in large-scale acts of murder in the United States has been unheard of for decades.</p> <p>Still, there are hundreds of thousands of automatic rifles in civilian hands, including more than 11,000 in Nevada, according to the ATF. How Paddock got his hands on one isn’t clear.</p> <p>The suspected shooter’s brother said in an interview that Paddock was “not an avid gun guy,” and said that “the fact that he had those kinds of weapons … where the hell did he get automatic weapons? He has no military background or anything like that.”</p>","Many politicians, members of the media, and other public figures are offering condolences as well as opinions in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 58 dead and 500 others injured in Las Vegas Sunday night.

And the problem has been getting worse in recent years.</p> <p>The Last Vegas Review-Journal reported that Las Vegas homicide detectives investigated 168 murders in 2016, nudging out 1996 as the deadliest year on record. (The police department did not provide the paper with records before 1990.) Though the city’s population has swelled in recent years, population growth doesn’t account for the considerable spike in the murder rate between the beginning of this decade, when murders hit a low of 76 in 2012, to last year. Most of the killings take place far from the famous Vegas strip that most tourists are familiar with, where Sunday night’s massacre unfolded. As of September of last year, 80 percent of the murders involved guns.</p> <p>Las Vegas was one of a few major American cities whose homicide rates contributed to an overall rise in the violent crime rate over the last two years.</p> <p>So far, 2017 is following much the same pattern.</p> <p>What accounts for the proliferation of violence in Las Vegas and other cities is not clear, and the question has been hotly debated. But Clark County sheriff Joseph Lombardo pinned at least some of the blame on gangs that have migrated from California. Domestic violence and young men who are quick to resort to violence appear to be common threads in the killings.</p> <p>A New York Times report from last year painted a picture of the daily toll the violence takes on the city’s residents and police officers, who had taken pride in the clearance rate of homicide investigations, but now find themselves overstretched.</p> <p>“You find out there was a minor altercation and someone pulled out a gun,” Lieutenant Daniel McGrath, head of the police department’s homicide unit, told the paper. “They are so quick to resort to violence that it goes from profanity to shooting.”</p> <p>Most of the killings, as with the majority of homicides in America, are committed with run-of-the-mill handguns, not the semi-automatic — or in Paddock’s cause, perhaps fully automatic — weapons that are often the weapon of choice in mass shootings.</p> <p>Las Vegas’s murder rate is likely to ebb and flow, but as long as guns are cheap and easily available, which they are in Nevada, it is likely to remain stubbornly high, and everyday acts of violence will continue to fade into the background.</p>","Many politicians, members of the media, and other public figures are offering condolences as well as opinions in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 58 dead and 500 others injured in Las Vegas Sunday night.

Brian Sandoval called the massacre a cowardly, despicable act and praised first responders, saying they saved scores of lives.</p> <p>""We're angry, we're grieving, we're confused, people are hurting,"" he said.</p> <p>Authorities first received calls about an active shooting at about 10:08 p.m. Country music star Jason Aldean was performing at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the gunfire erupted.</p> <p>Aldean was performing his last song of the night. Initially, those in attendance said they thought the sound was firecrackers. But as the shots continued, Aldean stopped singing and some concertgoers could be heard yelling to each other to get down.</p> <p>One witness told a local television station that he heard “hundreds of shots.” The gunfire was rapid and reportedly confused with firecrackers.</p> <p>""It sounded like a machine gun,"" one vendor told Fox News. ""It sounded like more than one machine gun.""</p> <p>Firearms experts hesitated Monday to attribute the shooter’s rapid fire from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino to an automatic weapon’s fire.</p> <p>Automatic weapons, sometimes referred to as machine guns, fire a stream of bullets when the trigger is pulled once and held down. They differ from semiautomatic weapons, which require one trigger pull for each round fired.</p> <p>Ryan Cleckner, a former U.S. Army Ranger sniper and author of “Long Range Shooting Handbook,” said the seemingly inconsistent rate of Paddock’s shooting may indicate he was using a device to mimic full-auto fire.</p> <p>These devices, such as a Slide Fire stock, are legal and can be bought for about $300.</p> <p>""These devices take advantage of a firearm’s natural recoil to ‘bump-fire’ the firearm thereby mimicking a machine gun without meeting the legal definition,” Cleckner told Fox News.</p> <p>Equipping an AR-15, for example, with a Slide Fire stock would be far cheaper and easier than buying a machine gun. Machine guns in the U.S. can cost upwards of $15,000 and require the buyer to undergo a personally intrusive and months-long application process with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p> <p>Country singer Jake Owen, who performed before Aldean, told Fox News the gunfire was ""non-stop.""</p> <p>""You couldn't tell where it was coming from. It was loud and non-stop,"" he said.</p> <p>Some concertgoers stayed behind to offer help to those around them.</p> <p>“Everybody I saw breathing, I helped,” a concertgoer told Fox News.</p> <p>The wife of a Tennessee man killed by the Las Vegas shooter said her husband died because he saved her from being shot. Heather Gulish Melton told Fox affiliate WZTV that her husband, Sonny Melton of Paris, Tennessee, was among the 50 killed Sunday night.</p> <p>Kodiak Yazzie, 36, said the music stopped temporarily and started up again before another round of pops sent the performers ducking for cover and fleeing the stage.</p> <p>""It was the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my entire life,"" Yazzie told the Associated Press. ""You could hear that the noise was coming from west of us, from Mandalay Bay. You could see a flash- flash- flash- flash.""</p> <p>As the thousands of fans in the crowd began to flee, Yazzie took cover and said he saw flashes of light coming from the Mandalay Bay hotel tower high above.</p> <p>Another concertgoer told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the shots sounded like fireworks, and she hid in a sewer.</p> <p>“It was a horror show,” Ivetta Saldana told the newspaper. “People were standing around, then they hit the floor.”</p> <p>Retired FBI special agent and former national FBI spokesman John Iannarelli, who drove past the scene of the event just moments before the shooting took place, told Fox News the massacre was ""obviously well-planned.""</p> <p>Iannarelli added the gunman used “expensive guns and ammunition.”</p> <p>Iannarelli noted that FBI and police are going to speak with every friend and relative, and are conducting forensic review of the suspect's computers and phones.</p> <p>The shooting at the sold-out Route 91 Harvest festival was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

According to the New York Daily News, Patrick Benjamin Paddock was arrested early in 1961 for robbing a bank in Phoenix in 1960 (he allegedly robbed other banks but was not charged with those offenses) while living in Tucson with his four children. He was caught trying to escape from jail in–sigh–Las Vegas, and was sent away, before successfully escaping late in 1968, which put him on the Most Wantedlist.</p> <p>The FBI poster (see above) from 1969 notes that Paddock the Elder had been “diagnosed as psychopathic, has carried firearms in commission of bank robberies” and “reportedly has suicidal tendencies and should be considered armed and very dangerous.”</p> <p>Fast-forward a couple of years, and Tucson’s Daily Citizen gave some more background on Paddock, before reporting that he had not been seen or heard of since making the Most Wanted list:</p> <p>BENJAMIN “CHROMEDOME” PADDOCK Ex-Tucsonian Makes FBI List Of 10 Most Wanted By GILBERT T. MATTHEWS Citizen Staff Writer Known to his associates as “Chromedome,” “Old Baldy,” and “Big Daddy,” Benjamin Hoskins Paddock is Tucson’s contribution to the FBI’s list of 10 most-wanted fugitives. He made the list after escaping on Dec. 31, 1968, from the Federal Correctional Institution at La Tuna, Tex., where he was serving a 20-year sentence for robbing a Phoenix bank in 1960. Paddock — alias Perry Archer, Benjamin J. Butler, Leo Genstein, Pat Paddock and Patrick Benjamin Paddock — hasn’t been seen or heard from since. At the time of the robbery, Paddock lived in Tucson with his wife and four children. Neighbors said they couldn’t believe that the colorful businessman, then 34 years old, was involved in crime. Paddock sold garbage disposal units here under the business name of Arizona Disposer “Chromedome” Co. He called himself “Big Daddy” in connection with a night club operation on North 1st Avenue. Before selling the disposal units, he operated an East Broadway service station and also sold used cars. Although he was imprisoned for the S4,620 holdup of a branch of the Valley National Bank in Phoenix, Paddock also had been accused of two other bank robberies. Those charges were dropped after his conviction. Federal officers reported that when he was arrested in Las Vegas, Paddock attempted to run down an FBI agent with his car. “Since he has utilized firearms in previous crimes, has employed violence in attempting to evade arrest and has been diagnosed as being psychopathic, Paddock should be considered extremely dangerous,” said Palmer M. Baken Jr., agent in charge of the Phoenix FBI office. Baker described Paddock as being “A glib, smooth-talking man who is egotistical and arrogant.”</p> <p>Paddock apparently stayed on the lam until 1978, when he was “captured in 1978 in Oregon where he was running a bingo parlor.”</p> <p>The sins of the father should not, of course, be visited upon the son, but this new intel on Stephen Paddock’s family history is obviously as germane to the mystery of his savage outbreak as any random speculation or ISIS claims.

Fully automatic weapons have been illegal to manufacture for civilian use since 1986, and those made before the cut off date are astronomically expensive and almost impossible to purchase. Of the 91 mass shootings committed in America since 1982, not one has been carried out using a fully automatic weapon. Kind of nullifies the whole stricter-gun-laws debate.</p> <p>And since Hillary brought up the whole silencer/suppressor debate, let’s review the facts.</p> <p>A silencer wasn’t used in today’s Las Vegas attack. And contrary to popular belief, silencers don’t really silence a weapon. They still make a sound reminiscent of a jackhammer. Additionally, .003% of suppressors are used in crimes each year.</p> <p>This isn’t opinion. These are the facts. The bottom line is that it’s really hard and highly expensive to be a legal gun owner in the US. No matter how seemingly lenient state gun laws may be, federal law still trumps state law. Stricter gun laws might dilute the Second Amendment and make it harder for law abiding citizens to own a firearm, but I would be remiss if I failed to mention that criminals don’t follow laws. That’s what makes them criminals.</p> <p>Besides, the Founding Fathers were pretty clear in their ideas about firearm possession. Take Thomas Jefferson, circa 1775:</p> <p>The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes…. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.</p> <p>The Second Amendment isn’t about arming every gun crazed citizen in the U.S. It’s about having the fundamental right as an American to own and protect his/her own property.</p> <p>So keep calling the NRA a terrorist organization that likes to see Americans killed. Keep likening it to ISIS and saying it needs red American blood on its hands.

We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.”</p> <p>It was an apparent reference to the NRA’s push to ease federal rules for silencers.</p> <p>But conservative critics quickly hit back, saying silencers probably would only moderately dampen the sound of gunfire in this kind of attack – especially from what was described as a high-powered weapon.</p> <p>“Suppressors only reduce by a few decibels, still same decibel level as a jackhammer,” tweeted Dana Loesch, a talk radio host and NRA spokeswoman.</p> <p>Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, editor in chief of The Daily Wire, blasted Clinton’s tweets as “Ignorant, irrelevant and exploitative.”</p> <p>Radio host and CIA veteran Buck Sexton had a similar take: “Appallingly stupid, and entirely irrelevant, Mrs Clinton She knows nothing about firearms, and even worse, she doesn't care.”</p> <p>White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also pushed back when asked about Clinton’s statements at Monday’s briefing.</p> <p>“I think before we start trying to talk about the preventions of what took place last night, we need to know more facts, and right now we’re simply not at that point,” Sanders said. “It is very easy for Mrs. Clinton to criticize and to come out, but I think we need to remember the only person with blood on their hands is that of the shooter, and this isn’t a time for us to go after individuals or organizations. I think we can have those policy conversations but today is not that day.”</p> <p>It’s unclear what weapons the shooter, identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, was using. Witnesses described the sound of rapid automatic gunfire – which many believed to be firecrackers – ringing out as thousands ran for cover. One vendor told Fox News that “it sounded like a machine gun.” Authorities said the shooter had more than 10 rifles in the hotel room where he fired on concert-goers below.</p> <p>The casualties in the attack exceeded those of the Pulse nightclub tragedy in Florida more than a year ago. As with the Pulse attack, the Las Vegas shooting led to prompt calls from Democrats – not just Clinton – for gun legislation, though the party has struggled to tighten laws even when the Obama administration was in power.</p> <p>Connecticut’s senators, who have been especially outspoken on gun control ever since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, were among the first to issue statements Monday.</p> <p>“Nowhere but America do horrific large-scale mass shootings happen with this degree of regularity,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a statement. “This must stop. It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren't public policy responses to this epidemic. There are, and the thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference. It's time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.""</p> <p>Connecticut’s other Democratic senator, Richard Blumenthal, issued a similar statement.</p> <p>“It has been barely a year since what was previously the largest mass shooting in American history – the deadly attack at Pulse nightclub. In the interim, thousands more have been lost to the daily, ruthless toll of gun violence. Still, Congress refuses to act. I am more than frustrated, I am furious,” he said.</p> <p>As the lawmakers seemed to acknowledge, gun legislation stands little chance of passing under a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.</p> <p>After the Pulse shooting, Senate Democrats launched a 15-hour filibuster followed by a Democratic sit-in on the House floor in a high-profile push for gun control legislation. But the divided Senate ultimately rejected all four gun measures put on the floor for a vote.</p> <p>The battle over gun restrictions has, meanwhile, played out in a more substantive fashion on the state level – and at the courts.</p> <p>Most recently, a federal appeals court last week delivered a win for gun rights activists by keeping in place another court’s ruling that it was unconstitutional for the District of Columbia to require gun owners to provide a “good reason” for legally carrying a concealed weapon in the nation’s capital. The dispute could be on a path to the Supreme Court.</p>","Many politicians, members of the media, and other public figures are offering condolences as well as opinions in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 58 dead and 500 others injured in Las Vegas Sunday night.

The top-line result is that Graham-Cassidy would reduce the number of insured by 21 million during the 2020–2026 period.</p> <p>More than anything, it reminded me of Ramesh Ponnuru’s argument that there’s no point waiting for CBO because it’s pretty easy to imagine what they’d say, but it’s worth digging into the report a bit.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Standard disclaimer: The bill does not lay out what happens to Obamacare funding after 2026. Congress will have to act again at that point, and you should completely ignore any estimate, from any source, going beyond that year. I will observe that rule here.</p> <p>The first thing to bear in mind is that their estimates are (naturally) based on previous work by the CBO, which rightly or wrongly believes the individual mandate to be quite effective. As many conservatives have pointed out, much of the CBO’s coverage losses thus can be characterized as people voluntarily going uninsured when they’re no longer required to. In fairness, though, there’s a follow-on effect as well: As healthy people opt out of insurance, premiums go up, causing more to opt out.</p> <p>The second thing to bear in mind is that since the whole point of Graham-Cassidy is to give states leeway to use (most of) Obamacare’s funding to set up their own health-care solutions, Fiedler and Adler have to guess as to what the states will do. Their solution is to divide states into four tiers that take approaches of varying generosity.</p> <p>Here they make a point that I think some conservatives will appreciate: Since money is fungible and the block grants have few strings attached, states can in effect use the cash to fund projects that have nothing to do with health care. This is how:</p> <p>All states would need to do is identify existing state health care programs that qualify for block grant funding, thereby freeing up the state dollars currently devoted to those program to be used in whatever way the state wishes. If this were a state’s goal, the legislation makes it easy to achieve. Total block grant funding under the Graham-Cassidy proposal is $200 billion in 2026. States could almost certainly use block grant funds to support programs that provide substance abuse and mental health services; non-Medicaid state and local government spending on such services is likely to be on the order of $50 billion in 2026. As another example, states could likely use block grant funding to finance health benefits for state and local employees; state costs in this area are likely to be on the order of $200 billion in 2026. Thus, these expenditures alone are more than sufficient to absorb the block grant funding that the Graham-Cassidy legislation would make available in 2026. States would likely identify many other categories of existing programs that could be funded with block grant dollars, such as programs that compensate medical providers for uncompensated care or spending on health care for prison inmates. In other instances, states might be able to direct money into their general funds by funneling them through public hospitals. While it is likely that some of these uses are not intended by the legislation’s authors, many of them may be difficult to disallow while still providing states with the broad discretion over the use of the block grant funds that the authors clearly do intend.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>On one hand, this just means Graham-Cassidy will be even more “federalist.” After all, it translates to more freedom for states to put the money to the use they think best — it allows them to decide the level of health-care spending in the state, not just the system through which the money will be spent. But on the other, conservatives are not fans of the federal government doling out cash to state governments for no particular reason. (An interesting possibility that occurred to me: Could liberal states play this shell game as well, and use the diverted money to, say, provide plans that cover abortion?)</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Fielder and Adler’s division of states seems at least defensible, however much guesswork it entails. States that declined to expand Medicaid, even though the federal government promised to pick up the overwhelming bulk of the tab, would be inclined to divert their money; blue states would be more inclined to continue Obamacare’s policies. The authors caution that their estimates do not account for the turmoil states will experience as they set up their own marketplaces, or for the bill’s cap on traditional Medicaid spending.</p> <p>Like I said: highly speculative, but worth digging into.</p>","Senator John McCain announced today that he would vote no on the latest Obamacare repeal bill, also known as the Graham-Cassidy proposal.

Strassel’s method of persuasion draws less on the theories of Hayek or Friedman and instead reflects the influence of the lesser-known conservative moral philosopher Vito Corleone.</p> <p>Strassel throws in a handful of substantive defenses of the Graham-Cassidy bill. She touts the “formula twiddles Senate Republicans are considering to ensure rural states aren’t harmed by Medicaid block grants” — which is to say, the Republican plan will harm tens of millions of people but allegedly spare the denizens of Murkowski’s state. But the heart of Strassel’s analysis is that Murkowski has a nice state here, and it would be a shame if something happened to it. If Murkowski does not accept the bribe, Strassel warns:</p> <p>She would get the fury of a White House and a GOP Congress with far more power over Alaska than just its health care. As Ms. Murkowski knows better than anyone, Alaska lives or dies on federal largess. It routinely tops the list of federal funding per capita. It receives billions in annual federal grants and billions more in defense spending. Federal money supports an estimated one-third of all the jobs and household income in the state.</p> <p>Some of these funds come from mandatory entitlement programs, but the money that really matters is discretionary. It’s the Denali Commission. It’s the Essential Air Service, which subsidizes flights in rural Alaska. It’s grants for weatherization, and village water projects, and salmon recovery. It’s wildlife refuge payments and bridges to nowhere. It’s upgrades for military bases.</p> <p>Later in Strassel’s column comes the “I’m a lawyer, I have not threatened you” passage:</p> <p>Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called Ms. Murkowski after her July health-care defection to let her know President Trump would be turning off the tap, and ending Alaska’s enormous opportunity to cash in on energy deregulation. The liberal press howled over this supposed “threat.” But why should the nation continue to send outsize taxpayer funds to a state that is single-handedly condemning Americans to ObamaCare?</p> <p>Consider the progression of thoughts here. In the first sentence of this paragraph, Strassel describes a Trump administration threat to exact policy retribution on a completely unrelated policy area if Murkowski opposed their bill. In the next sentence, she insists it’s not really a threat. (The word gets a set of scare quotes along with a supposed.) And then, in the next sentence, she contradicts the previous one by underscoring the threat and arguing that it’s justified. Why, asks Strassel, should the government upgrade military bases in Alaska if Murkowski is unwilling to sign a bill that she believes would hurt people?</p> <p>Threats only work if the target believes the person issuing them is completely unethical. What’s most telling about the congressional Republicans’ warning, issued via Strassel, is that it makes no distinction between legitimate and illegitimate spending. Presumably there could be some kind of neutral good-government test of spending programs that distinguishes between those with merit and those without. Strassel just tosses them all — military-base upgrades, which she presumably considers merited, and bridges to nowhere, which she presumably does not — into the same category.</p> <p>This threat would be worthless if Murkowski believed the congressional Republicans would evaluate spending programs that benefit Alaska on their merits. But that possibility is clearly so naive Strassel does not even bother to deny it. Strassel just straight-up operates from the assumption that of course completely unrelated programs will be either approved or canceled on the basis of political blackmail.</p>","Senator John McCain announced today that he would vote no on the latest Obamacare repeal bill, also known as the Graham-Cassidy proposal.

Photos: Getty Images</p> <p>Senate Republicans know very little about what their new health-care plan would actually do. This is because the bill’s primary author left the Senate in 2006, and the legislation he wrote has been public for all of eight days. “If there was an oral exam on the contents of the proposal, graded on a generous curve, only two Republicans could pass it,” a senior Republican aide told a reporter this week — before stipulating that the bill’s putative co-author, Lindsey Graham, was not one of them.</p> <p>But you need not take an anonymous aide’s word on it. On Tuesday, Vox’s Jeff Stein asked nine GOP senators what problems the Graham-Cassidy health-care bill solves, and how it solves them. The lawmakers responded with platitudes about federalism, the phrase “read the bill and you’ll understand,” and a bizarre reference to the final scene of Thelma and Louise.</p> <p>Still, Republicans know a few things about their latest iteration of Trumpcare. They know that the bill reforms one-sixth of the American economy so radically the Congressional Budget Office will need weeks to generate a detailed analysis of its likely effects; that every major health-care-industry stakeholder — from doctors and patients and hospitals to insurers and medical charities — opposes the legislation; that seven of their own party’s governors also oppose it; that health-care-policy analysts believe the bill would make health insurance unaffordable for many people with preexisting conditions; that it would radically reduce Medicaid and federal subsidies for health insurance; and that some analysts say those cuts would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 32 million over the next decade.</p> <p>And yet, according to reports, at least 48 Republican senators are ready to vote for the bill next week. Which raises the question: Why is almost every GOP senator ready to vote for widely reviled legislation that they do not understand?</p> <p>The popular answer is that they feel a political obligation to make good on their promises to the conservative base, regardless of the implications for public policy. Remarkably, several senators have stated, explicitly, that this is their calculus.</p> <p>“You know, I could maybe give you ten reasons why this bill shouldn’t be considered,” Iowa’s Chuck Grassley told reporters in his state Wednesday. “But Republicans campaigned on this so often that you have a responsibility to carry out what you said in the campaign. That’s pretty much as much of a reason as the substance of the bill.”</p> <p>Senators are not supposed to support legislation that they believe to be unworthy of consideration on substantive grounds just because they promised their voters that they would support a bill of that general type. The entire point of having a republic — as opposed to a direct democracy — is that the former enables elected representatives to exercise independent judgement in policy-making.</p> <p>Still, as contemptible as Grassley’s official rationale for supporting Graham-Cassidy is, his party’s actual motivation for pushing the bill is (almost certainly) more sinister. In truth, Graham-Cassidy does not fulfill the Republican Party’s promises to its voters — and there is virtually no evidence that said voters would punish the party for failing to pass it. The bill does, however, advance the priorities of the GOP’s big-dollar donors — and there is significant evidence that they would punish the Republican lawmakers if the legislation fails.</p> <p>It’s true that Republicans have spent nearly a decade promising voters that they would “repeal and replace Obamacare.” But most Republicans specifically promised to replace the law with one that would make health-care benefits more generous and universally affordable. Our Republican president promised to preserve Medicaid in its current form and achieve universal coverage with lower deductibles. The mogul even went so far as to explicitly disavow the conservative movement’s traditional hostility to the welfare state, telling 60 Minutes, “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.”</p> <p>Trump wasn’t the only one singing such a tune. Virtually all of the GOP’s leading lights attacked Obamacare from the left, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who lamented in January, “There are 25 million Americans who aren’t covered now … And many Americans who actually did get insurance — when they did not have it before — have really bad insurance that they have to pay for, and the deductibles are so high that it’s really not worth much to them.”</p> <p>McConnell, Trump, and their co-partisans pretended to support a more generous government health program for a reason: That is what most Republican voters want. Earlier this year, a Morning Consult survey found that a majority of conservatives — and a large plurality of self-identified tea-party supporters — thought that “the government should spend more on health care.”</p> <p>Turns out Tea Party voters want more government healthcare spending, yet support Ryan's healthcare bill. Go figure. https://t.co/y77gXZHn6j pic.twitter.com/VT7W2FqDPC — Guy Kawasaki (@GuyKawasaki) March 23, 2017</p> <p>Those findings are consistent with polling from Pew Research, which back in May found 61 percent of Republican voters saying that government funding levels for health care should be maintained or increased. Meanwhile, according to a recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 12 percent of all U.S. adults support cuts to Medicaid (which happens to be about the percentage of the public that supported the Senate’s previous Medicaid-gutting, Obamacare-repeal bill).</p> <p>Graham-Cassidy would cut federal spending on insurance subsides and the Medicaid expansion by an estimated $243 billion between 2020 and 2026. That is neither what Republicans campaigned on, nor what their constituents want.</p> <p>But it is what their most affluent donors want — or at least they believe it moves the ball in their desired direction. While Republican voters are broadly supportive of Medicaid — and many GOP senators from Medicaid-expansion states have touted their support for the policy — the conservative donor network funded by the oil billionaires Charles and David Koch has been unequivocal in its opposition to the federal program.</p> <p>“Our network voraciously opposed Medicaid expansion in state after state,” Tim Phillips, head of the Koch-funded nonprofit Americans for Prosperity, told GOP donors at the Koch Network’s June retreat. “These Republicans who expanded Medicaid were flatly wrong. So we’re going to continue holding these Republicans accountable.”</p> <p>At the same retreat, the Koch brothers themselves complained that the Republican health-care bill — which, at the time, already included significant cuts to Medicaid — was insufficiently conservative. That bill failed, amid widespread public opposition to its austerity. Senate Republicans responded by drafting a new iteration of Trumpcare that cuts Medicaid — and subsidies for health insurance — even more severely.</p> <p>In voting for Graham-Cassidy, Republican senators might fulfill promises they made to Charles Koch in Colorado Springs. But most would actually be breaking their promises to voters. Multiple GOP senators pledged to vote against any bill that failed to preserve protections for people with preexisting conditions, address the opioid crisis, or reduce insurance premiums.</p> <p>Graham-Cassidy fails to do all of these things. In fact, its scheme for block-granting federal health-care spending to the states is so haphazard and ill-thought-out, it would lead insurers to drastically increase their premiums, so as to protect themselves against market uncertainty.</p> <p>The notion that Republicans need to pass a bill that will increase the cost of health insurance — and break a variety of substantive promises to their constituents — for the sake of political expediency is bizarre. The only evidence for this view is that Republican voters still support “Obamacare repeal.” But if GOP lawmakers want to vote for a health-care bill that breaks their substantive promises to voters — and call it “Obamacare repeal” — they have better options.</p> <p>Days ago, Senate Democrats offered to support waivers that would allow red states to opt out of some Obamacare regulations, in exchange for funding to shore up the exchanges. This legislation would have averted a significant spike in insurance premiums next year — and, in keeping federal funding for health-care constant, it would have been closer to the substantive wishes of GOP voters than Graham-Cassidy is. What’s more, some Democrats were prepared to let President Trump call the measure “Obamacare repeal.”</p> <p>There is no reason to believe that the GOP’s political interests would be better served by passing a radical bill that will increase health-insurance premiums than by passing a bipartisan one that will reduce them — unless one stipulates that doing the latter would alienate big-dollar donors. Trump voters overwhelmingly approved of the president’s bipartisan debt-ceiling deal — and independents appear to have been even more enthusiastic.</p> <p>The GOP base is not allergic to bipartisanship and compromise, so long as it’s their champion who’s making the deals. But the Koch brothers are. The Kochs do not oppose Obamacare because the program doesn’t work well enough — they oppose it because they find it morally wrong for the state to take money from wealthy people and use it to subsidize health insurance for non-wealthy people. Thus, technocratic fixes that make government-subsidized health care work better are antithetical to their project. Their interest is not in improving the Affordable Care Act, but in discrediting the premise on which it is based: that redistributive government programs can improve health care for most Americans.</p> <p>And the Kochs and their ilk have made clear that Republicans who buck them will face consequences. This week, NBC News’ Kasie Hunt tweeted, “Republicans heard loud & clear from donors this August that do-nothing isn’t going to cut it.” At the Koch retreat in June, at least one major donor threatened to close “the Dallas piggy bank” until repeal was passed. In August, one Republican donor responded to the apparent death of Obamacare repeal by actually suing the party for fraud.</p> <p>Republicans don’t need donations from billionaires more than they need the votes of their base. But the former pay far closer attention to the details of policy. On fiscal matters, it is much riskier for Republicans to buck their donors than to betray the constituents who elected them.</p> <p>Senate Republicans are on the cusp of radically reforming our health-care system in ways that they do not fully understand — and that industry stakeholders and GOP voters broadly oppose — out of fear that a few dozen obscenely wealthy libertarians will evict them from Congress if they don’t.</p> <p>If Graham-Cassidy becomes law, our nation will enter a health-care crisis.

Desch, director of the International Security Center at the University of Notre Dame, said Mr. Trump will succeed in his first U.N. speech if it looks like the world is with him.</p> <p>“He can look statesmanlike by rallying the international community around this issue rhetorically with no real expectation of having to achieve anything,” he said. “Bashing [North Korea] is what economists call a ‘solidarity good.’ The purpose is to unite the group, not achieve anything beyond it.”</p> <p>A week ago, the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which includes China and Russia, unanimously adopted its ninth sanctions resolution since 2006 over North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</p> <p>North Korea has not been deterred. The North made its 15th missile test last week, lobbing one over northern Japan for a second time. A nuclear weapon detonated early this month, which Pyongyang claimed was a hydrogen bomb, was its most powerful to date.</p> <p>As Mr. Trump prepared his speech, which he spent hours crafting to present his vision of America to the world, the U.S. military was conducting exercises flying advanced bombers and stealth jets over the Korean Peninsula.</p> <p>The joint exercises with South Korea presented a demonstration of U.S. military power just days after North Korea’s latest missile test.</p> <p>In the speech, Mr. Trump also is expected to address Iran, a sponsor of terrorism and a destabilizing actor throughout the Middle East. The Trump administration is mulling whether to certify Tehran’s compliance with an Obama-era deal to slow the Iranian nuclear weapons program.</p> <p>Mr. Trump has said Iran is not living up to the spirit of the agreement.</p> <p>The speech will attempt to rally other countries to do their part. Rather than minimizing the role of the United Nations, the official said, Mr. Trump will present “an optimistic vision for international cooperation based on respecting individual sovereignty.”</p> <p>“It is a shared menace,” the official said. “Nations cannot be bystanders to history. If we don’t confront these threats now, they will only gather force and become more formidable.”</p> <p>A united front could lay the groundwork for a diplomatic path to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea crisis, said Mona Khalil of Independent Diplomat, an international relations consulting firm.</p> <p>“Even when fully and meaningfully implemented, sanctions alone do not work. They never have. Such sticks must be coupled with one or more of the following carrots: respect, recognition, negotiation and/or nonaggression,” Ms. Khalil said.</p> <p>Mr. Trump was in a position to forge a consensus with China and Russia, as well as with South Korea and Japan, on what North Korea must do to get a seat at the negotiating table, she said.</p> <p>“To offer any such incentive, however, there must first be a viable table. As such, the U.S. and China must stand together and the five must present a united front before a diplomatic breakthrough is possible,” she said. “China is the essential partner in that endeavor; to be a reliable one, China will need consistency and demand respect from its American counterpart.”</p> <p>Mr. Trump prodded Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call Monday from the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. In the call, the two leaders committed to “maximizing pressure” on North Korea through vigorous enforcement of the U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to the White House.</p> <p>However, China’s Communist Party newspaper earlier had blasted the U.S. for demanding that Beijing increase the pressure on Pyongyang to halt its development of nuclear weapons.</p> <p>“The so-called China’s responsibility theory is essentially moral kidnapping,” the People’s Daily said in an editorial. It also said that sanctions should not harm “legitimate economic and trade exchanges between North Korea and the outside world” or the lives of everyday people.</p> <p>China accounts for about 90 percent of North Korea’s trade and sends practically free crude oil shipments to the North. Beijing has been increasingly frustrated with North Korea’s nuclear drive, but it still doesn’t want the North to collapse.

This unit – known as CI – is one of the federal government’s most tight-knit, specialized, and secretive investigative entities. Its 2,500 agents focus exclusively on financial crime, including tax evasion and money laundering. A former colleague of Mueller’s said he always liked working with IRS’ special agents, especially when he was a U.S. Attorney. And it goes without saying that the IRS has access to Trump’s tax returns – documents that the president has long resisted releasing to the public.</p> <p>NBC News has not verified The Daily Beast’s reporting, though as Joy noted on last night’s show, the trajectory of the probe makes sense.</p> <p>The president, you’ll recall, recently said he expects – and to a certain extent, demands – that Mueller’s investigation will steer clear of his finances. That’s never been an especially realistic expectation: if the probe leads to questions about whether the president has been compromised by a foreign adversary, it stands to reason the investigation will include a financial component.</p> <p>All of which gives Trump and his allies another reason to worry about the seriousness of this scandal.</p> <p>Paul Butler, an MSNBC legal analyst and a former federal prosecutor, added on the show last night, “These are the big dogs of white collar prosecutions. They not only know how to follow the money, they know how to make a case and explain it to a jury in a way that makes it want to convict. So, I always say we’re a long way from charges being brought, but if there’s a criminal case, if you’re a defendant, the last people you want going against you is C.I., the criminal investigations unit of the tax division.”</p> <p>* Postscript: The Daily Beast’s reporting added that if Mueller wanted to bring charges related to tax law at some point in the future, he’d need approval from the Justice Department’s elite Tax Division. That could be a little tricky: “Trump hasn’t yet named his pick to run the division, which is a post that requires Senate confirmation.”</p>","Robert Mueller is now partnering with the Criminal Investigations Unit at the IRS to proceed with the Trump-Russia probe.

No blank checks there.","<p>Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p> <p>Days before Donald Trump was sworn in as president, the Supreme Court heard the very last case of the Obama administration — a civil-rights dispute over whether high-ranking federal officials can be held accountable for violating people’s constitutional rights. Justice Stephen Breyer, an institutional pragmatist, seemed to seize on the case to portend the heavy lift that awaited the justice system in the years ahead: “There’s no blank check, even for the president,” he said during the hearing. “And if there’s no blank check, that means sometimes they can go too far. And if they have gone too far, it is our job to say that.”</p> <p>The tragedy of Trump’s “full pardon” of disgraced Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio is that there’s nothing anyone can do to check it. Certainly not the courts: The pardon is not only unconditional and irrevocable, but also an affront to judicial authority writ large — part and parcel of the president’s ongoing feud with federal judges who don’t rule as he’d like.</p> <p>The reason Arpaio’s reprieve is a slap in the face to the courts is that the crime originated in the courts. U.S. District Judge Murray Snow — a deeply conservative George W. Bush appointee who for years oversaw a civil case accusing the sheriff of trampling on Latinos’ constitutional rights — held him in contempt of court for doing precisely the thing he was being sued over. Snow had had it with Arpaio’s recalcitrance: He and his cronies “have demonstrated a persistent disregard for the orders of the Court, as well as an intention to violate and manipulate the laws and policies regulating their conduct,” he wrote in a contempt order last year.</p> <p>Arpaio’s trail of racist lawlessness is endless. But this was the first time that his disregard for the rule of law rose to the level of a criminal offense — Snow found his violations serious enough under federal law that he felt a referral to the Department of Justice was necessary. And once all was said and done, it was Trump’s own Justice Department that prosecuted Arpaio and scored a conviction against him before a different judge just last month. The evidence was conclusive: “Because the Court finds that Defendant willfully violated an order of the court, it finds Defendant guilty of criminal contempt.”</p> <p>None of that matters now. Trump’s pardon short-circuits the entire process: Arpaio hadn’t even been sentenced yet. The pardon effectively disrupts the work of career DOJ lawyers who were preparing for the sentencing phase; of court officers who were readying a pre-sentence report to guide the sentencing judge; of Arpaio’s own lawyers, who just last week filed court papers seeking to quash Arpaio’s conviction; of the judge who was due to sentence the sheriff in October. The wheels of justice ground to a halt simply because the nation’s chief executive said so. As with other matters that are still within the purview of prosecutors, like Bob Mueller’s inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice in the Russia probe, Trump is once again inserting himself in criminal proceedings that are yet to run their course. As one former White House counsel put it in Lawfare, “a pardon will have every appearance of being direct interference in the administration of justice.”</p> <p>Trump may very well believe that Arpaio was adjudged a convicted criminal simply for “doing his job,” as he told a cheerful crowd in Phoenix earlier this week. The two share a bond over rounding up bad hombres, after all, and then some. But no law-enforcement officer’s job description includes a carte blanche to violate constitutional rights, let alone flout court orders to stop doing so. On its own terms, the pardon flies in the face of Trump’s purported law-and-order presidency.</p> <p>Maybe Trump meant for the pardon to be interpreted as a reward for Arpaio’s faithful surrogacy during the presidential campaign. Maybe it’s a presidential show of gratitude for being the only ally with the “guts” to not give up on the birther crusade against President Obama. Or maybe Trump is simply being Trump — playing to his base by pardoning the unpardonable just because he can, and because it would drive the other side mad. “We polled the race stuff and it didn’t matter,” Stephen Bannon infamously told Joshua Green. More red meat for the red-hat crowd.</p> <p>No one knows what other clemency initiatives Trump has in store for what remains of his presidency, and this one in particular, egregious though it may be, will not result in impeachment. But it’s a harbinger of what’s to come for a president and an administration that will soon be forced to reckon more and more with another lawman who will be sure to treat every interference — and preemptive pardon — as the obstruction that it is.

Secretary DeVos, a Christian grandmother and philanthropist who has spent her career trying to improve the quality of education for poor children, has been criticized and mocked relentlessly. And she is the only Cabinet secretary who travels with a cadre of U. S. Marshals because of death threats she’s received.</p> <p>So why, as “60 Minutes”’ Lesley Stahl put it, has Secretary DeVos become the “most hated Cabinet secretary?”</p> <p>One reason—as opinion pieces in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have argued—is that some of the Democratic party’s most deep-pocketed and powerful interest groups are teachers’ unions who realize that they will no longer have a near-monopoly on education.</p> <p>Another reason, as the New York Times’ Ross Douthat argued, is that the Democratic party’s upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency - who are big supporters, in theory, of public education – bristle at the idea of DeVos’ charters and vouchers being attractive to poor and minority families (who in their view belong in public schools) or families with ideological or religious convictions that differ from their own.</p> <p>On second thought, I guess it’s not so hard to understand why the left’s hard-core education bureaucracy is so opposed to her. She is a serious threat to the status quo that has served them – if not students – so well.</p> <p>Perhaps the most significant reason, however, is the one Secretary DeVos gave in response to Stahl’s question: more than anything else, she is misunderstood.</p> <p>To clear up any misunderstanding caused by the left’s holy war against her, here are four things Americans should understand about Secretary DeVos’ educational vision:</p> <p>First, as she noted in the “60 Minutes” interview, Secretary DeVos wants to liberate American education from encroachment by federal bureaucracy. Under the Obama administration, the federal government functioned as a giant octopus, bypassing families, communities, and states in order to reach its tentacles into school curriculum, teacher evaluation, values conformity, and even restroom policies. Betsy DeVos signals a departure from that era. Her stated educational philosophy suggests that she will not turn Democratic encroachment into Republican encroachment; instead, she will reduce federal encroachment in order to empower families, local communities, and states.</p> <p>Second, Secretary DeVos emphasizes freedom of thought. During her confirmation hearings, the media made much ado about her “Dutch Calvinist” religious views. But Dutch Calvinism is a rich religious tradition that emphasizes the rights and freedoms of families, communities, and religions. For that reason, it finds adherents on the right and on the left. Additionally, it places an especially high value on education, but emphasizes that a plural society should be tolerant enough to allow diverse families and communities to build their own educational institutions and choose which institution(s) their children can attend. Unfortunately, many liberal educators are quite illiberal, unwilling to tolerate any type of educational diversity that undermines the federal government’s impulse toward command-and-control.</p> <p>Third, she wants to empower financially-disadvantaged families to send their children to whichever school they deem best. Under the current system, the government taxes citizens in order to provide education, but then dictates and determines how the tax money can be used. The message is clear: the federal government—rather than the family or local community—is responsible for shaping the way a child understands and interprets the world.</p> <p>Under Secretary DeVos’ system of vouchers and charters, however, citizens will be able to exercise more influence over their own child’s education. They will also be able to send their children to a wider variety of schools, including those that would have been financially prohibitive without the vouchers. This sort of system is supported by prominent intellectuals and educators such as Anthony Bradley and has been supported in the past by Democratic politicians such as Cory Booker.</p> <p>Fourth, Secretary Devos does not come to her job as a career politician or an educational ideologue. She comes as a lifelong education advocate and philanthropist who has given tens of millions of dollars to public and private educational institutions.</p> <p>As her “60 Minutes” interview made clear, Secretary DeVos is an imperfect Secretary of Education, as all secretaries of education have been. She is neither a career politician nor a pundit.</p> <p>What she is is a skilled educational advocate and a lifelong educational philanthropist whose vision for education could reduce bureaucracy, increase free thinking, and empower the financially disadvantaged, thus helping children to get the education they deserve.</p> <p>On second thought, I guess it’s not so hard to understand why the left’s hard-core education bureaucracy is so opposed to her.

They’re so determined to provide tax giveaways to the rich that they’re willing to raise premiums on millions of middle-class Americans and kick 13 million people off their health care,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.</p> <p>He predicted that the bill would sour more Americans on the Republicans’ plans.</p> <p>But Republican leaders are counting on the move to win over wavering senators, saying the savings from nixing the mandate can be pumped back into even bigger tax cuts for the middle class.</p> <p>Before the mandate, the Senate plan amounts to a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years, with about 60 percent going to businesses and the rest going to individual taxpayers. The plan slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and lowers the top individual rate from 39.6 percent to 38.5 percent while adjusting other individual tax brackets so they kick in at higher income thresholds.</p> <p>Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch said including the mandate repeal allows Republicans to be even more ambitious with their plan.</p> <p>“By scrapping this unpopular tax from an unworkable law, we not only ease the financial burdens already associated with the mandate, but also generate additional revenue to provide more tax relief to … individuals,” Mr. Hatch said.</p> <p>The 20 percent corporate rate would be permanent but the new individual income tax rates would expire after 2025 under the modified outline Mr. Hatch released Tuesday evening.</p> <p>The new plan costs about $1.415 trillion – down from the $1.496 trillion plan rolled out last week.</p> <p>Mr. Hatch also announced other revisions Tuesday, including a doubling of the child tax credit from the current $1,000 to $2,000 — up from $1,650 in the first plan — and some other tweaks to individual tax rates.</p> <p>Another revision makes changes so more “pass-through” companies that file their taxes as individuals can claim a new 17.4 percent deduction Republicans say is designed to give a boost to small businesses.</p> <p>“The pass-through provisions in the chairman’s mark have been further streamlined to ensure these critical job creators have access to the resources they need to further expand, help hire new workers, and increase employee take-home pay,” Mr. Hatch said.</p> <p>The plan also eliminates a number of deductions, such as the one for state and local taxes paid, and uses the savings to pay for lowering the rates.</p> <p>With the plan bumping up against the $1.5 trillion cap set in the 2018 budget for tax cuts, lawmakers were left searching for new ways to free up money to do even more for the middle class.</p> <p>Enter the individual mandate plan, which the Congressional Budget Office said would save the government more than $300 billion over the next 10 years by freeing people from the obligation to have health care coverage — and the government from the responsibility of subsidizing much of that coverage.</p> <p>Some 13 million fewer people would have coverage in 2027 without the pressure from the mandate.</p> <p>Some Republicans had long pushed for the move, saying it was the natural solution to their failure this year to repeal Obamacare.</p> <p>Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, Pennsylvania Republican and a member of the tax-writing finance committee, said the mandate is based on a “flawed premise” that the federal government should force Americans to buy a product they might not want.</p> <p>“Including the repeal of the tax penalty in our pro-growth tax reform bill gives direct relief to hardworking Pennsylvanians and assists in making permanent desperately needed changes to our outdated tax code so American businesses can be globally competitive once again,” said Mr. Toomey.</p> <p>Democrats, though, framed the move as cutting a government benefit for average Americans in order to give corporations a tax reduction.</p> <p>“This is a con job on the American people and proves that Republicans’ only agenda is putting an economic double standard into black letter law,” said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.</p> <p>Republicans hope to move their broader bill through committee this week, with possible floor action the week after Thanksgiving, as they look to get a final package to Mr. Trump’s desk by the end of the year.</p> <p>The admittedly ambitious time frame comes as some Republicans view the tax overhaul effort as the party’s last real chance to give voters a reason to turn out in next year’s midterm elections, after their monthslong effort to repeal Obamacare in its entirety stalled out over the summer.</p> <p>The House tax bill that advanced out of the Ways and Means Committee last week did not include a repeal of the mandate, though some Republicans said they would like it to be part of the discussion as leaders prepare for a floor vote in the House this week.</p> <p>House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said Tuesday that the House is pushing the bill “as we have it,” though he described things as a work in progress.</p> <p>He said differences between the House and Senate versions can ultimately get hammered out in a bicameral conference committee once each chamber passes its respective plan.</p> <p>“So we are just getting this process going. We think it’s very, very important we produce this. And we feel good where we are,” Mr. Ryan said.</p> <p>The House plan also lowers the corporate tax rate to 20 percent immediately, while the Senate version delays it for one year.</p> <p>The House also includes a full repeal of the estate tax on inheritances, while the Senate doubles the exemption rate but leaves the tax in place, and partially restores part of the state and local deduction for property taxes.</p>",Senate Republicans on Tuesday revised their tax cut bill to include a repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate — a bold move that frees up more money for deeper tax cuts and takes a whack at the health care law they have repeatedly tried but failed to repeal.

She compared it to the yearslong effort to pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Act, which was enacted in 2003.</p> <p>“We have hope,” Ms. Mancini said. “Unless we start to make these strides on one side, then we won’t on the other side. The partial-birth abortion ban took a long time to get passed and ultimately enacted. So I see it a little bit like that.”</p> <p>Introduced by Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona Republican, the Pain-Capable Act would criminalize the performance of abortion after 20 weeks of gestation except in the cases of rape, incest or threat to the life of the mother.</p> <p>The White House issued a statement Monday reaffirming President Trump’s intention to sign the bill if it reaches his desk.</p> <p>“The Administration strongly supports H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and applauds the House of Representatives for continuing its efforts to secure critical pro-life protections,” the statement said.</p> <p>The House held an emotional debate over the bill prior to its passage.</p> <p>Rep. Christopher H. Smith, New Jersey Republican, said children born prematurely at 20 weeks can laugh, cry and feel pain. He said the law shouldn’t treat children differently based on if they’re in the womb or not.</p> <p>“Again, these children are there being assisted, and if you touch them, if you try to dismember them once they’re born, they will feel the pain,” Mr. Smith said. “In like manner, an unborn child at 20 weeks gestation will feel the pain.”</p> <p>Rep. Mia B. Love, Utah Republican, said “each human life should be protected under the rule of law.”</p> <p>“Each life that feels pain should be free from being tortured,” Ms. Love said. “I cannot believe that we are here on the floor of the House, the people’s House, continuing to plead and ask for life.”</p> <p>Twenty states currently have 20-week abortion bans on the books. But opponents of such legislation argue it’s unconstitutional.</p> <p>“When life puts a woman in even the toughest of circumstances, the highest court in the land said the decision that she makes should be hers, free from any interference from the government,” said Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter, New York Democrat. “Roe v. Wade is a firewall that women rely on, but with every passing year and every new session of Congress, politicians have tried to chip away at it brick by brick, hoping it will crumble away.”</p> <p>Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, New Jersey Democrat, told a story about one of her constituents named Carrie who procured a late-term abortion because she didn’t want her child, who had been diagnosed with several fetal abnormalities, to suffer.</p> <p>“The doctor informed them that infants with this condition very rarely survive more than a few days after delivery,” Ms. Watson Coleman said. “According to Carrie, ‘We both calmly made the decision to have an abortion. We did not want our little girl to suffer; we would much rather take on that suffering for her.’”</p> <p>About 2 percent of all abortions in America occur after 20 weeks gestation. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the Pain-Capable Act could prevent as many as 10,000 late-term abortions from taking place every year.</p> <p>Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said Democrats will probably block the bill once it reaches the Senate.</p> <p>But he said Tuesday’s vote is important because it forced lawmakers to come out for or against late-term abortion and raised awareness about the prevalence of the procedure in America.</p> <p>“The fact is we’re one of seven countries in the world that allows elective abortion after 20 weeks in most states,” Mr. Donovan said. “The education lets people know not only that it’s legal, but that babies are surviving premature birth.

It is our moral obligation to get it right.”</p> <p>Bloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump shakes hands with Betsy DeVos during a parent-teacher conference listening session inside the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017.</p> <p>Although just between 2 and 10 percent of reported rapes turn out to be false claims, DeVos devoted equal time to the stories of sexual assault survivors and those wrongly accused as if the group is the same size as survivors of sexual violence.</p> <p>“This campus official, who may or may not have any training in adjudicating sexual misconduct, is expected to render a judgment,” DeVos said, walking the crowd through the Title IX process. “A judgment that changes the direction of both students’ lives. The right to appeal may or may not be available to either party and no one is permitted to talk about what went on behind closed doors. It’s no wonder so many call these proceedings kangaroo courts.”</p> <p>Notably, the groups that most often refer to Title IX proceedings as “kangaroo courts” are Men’s Rights Activists and others who believe that the Title IX process is built to favor accusers over the accused.</p> <p>DeVos’ announcement doesn’t come as a surprise to many advocacy groups who have had concerns about the Secretary of Education’s views on Title IX since she was confirmed in February.</p> <p>There are no two sides when it comes to rape. Period. Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of UltraViolet</p> <p>Before the announcement, survivor advocacy groups including End Rape on Campus and Know Your IX, NARAL and the Feminist Majority Foundation rallied outside of the law school as a sign of protest. Many protestors tweeted their support of the advocacy groups using the hashtag #StopBetsy.</p> <p>“There are no two sides when it comes to rape. Period,” NitaChaudhary, co-founder of feminist organization UltraViolet, said in a press statement after DeVos’ announcement. “With sexual assaults routinely going unreported, un-investigated and unpunished, the scales are already heavily tipped in the favor of rapists. The idea that we need to focus more on the rights of the accused would be laughable if it weren’t so terrifying and outright dangerous.”</p> <p>Anti-sexual violence organization KnowYourIX put out a similar statement after DeVos’ announcement:</p> <p>Today, Secretary DeVos sent the message to student and survivors across the country that the Department of Education doesn’t have their back. Before the Education Department took action to protect survivors, and hold schools accountable, too many young people were forced to drop classes they shared with their rapists, take long leaves of absence, or even leave school entirely. The Department’s guidance, which outlined survivors’ rights under longstanding federal law, was a response to this urgent reality. Today’s announcement risks taking us back to to the days when sexual violence routinely compromised survivors’ access to education and schools swept sexual assault under the rug.</p> <p>Alexandra Brodsky, a civil rights attorney and co-founder of KnowYourIX, told HuffPost earlier this week that rescinding the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter does not actually change the law.</p> <p>“The [Title IX] law hasn’t changed at all,” Brodsky told HuffPost. “Survivors have the same rights, schools have the same responsibility.” The concern advocates have is that there will be less clarity for all parties involved in Title IX adjudication. “It helps students understand what their rights are. But it’s not just survivors who are really going to struggle with this,”Jess Davidson, Managing Director of End Rape on Campus told HuffPost. “The people who use the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter the most ― or are supposed to use it the most ― are Title IX administrators, the people who are conducting these investigations on campuses across the country.”</p>",Betsy Devos announced that she will roll back regulations on college campuses that the Obama administration put into place in order to protect victims of sexual assault.,Left,Left,0.0,-5.0,"[""4""]",,Left,True

But he now is virtually their only hope for easing the tensions at the Philadelphia convention, where delegates are poised to crown Clinton as the party’s presidential nominee on Tuesday.</p> <p>“I understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process. I think it’s fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am,” he told delegates. “But to all of our supporters – here and around the country – I hope you take enormous pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved.”</p> <p>Sanders argued that, despite his differences with Clinton during the primary campaign, her views are far more in line with his than are Republican nominee Trump’s – on issues ranging from the minimum wage to climate change to college tuition costs.</p> <p>“It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues,” he said. But Sanders said they have come together on some of them, and his side was able to win major changes to the party platform.</p> <p>“Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her tonight,” Sanders said, though some in the audience still booed at Clinton’s name.</p> <p>Trump, tweeting from the sidelines, fired back:</p> <p>Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton.

I’m with Hillary.”</p> <p>She called Trump a ""man who inherited a fortune from his father” and cares only for himself.</p> <p>""Donald Trump has no real plans for jobs, for college kids, for seniors.

But Warren called Clinton “a woman who fights for all of us.”</p> <p>Together, the two speakers had an opportunity to tamp down the unrest among liberal activists, many of whom not only backed Sanders during the turbulent primary battle but wanted to either see Warren step into the ring or be tapped for running mate. Whether their words can now help calm the storm inside and outside the convention hall remains to be seen.</p> <p>Sanders’ speech could help. “It was a very unifying message, the essence of unity,” Kit Andrews, a Vermont alternate delegate and Sanders supporter, told FoxNews.com. “It’s a long process to bring people together. He has always said that.”</p> <p>Sanders and Warren, along with Michelle Obama and Clinton booster New Jersey Sen.

Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, who was presiding, scolded the protesters as they interrupted at the very mention of Clinton.</p> <p>“We are all Democrats, and we need to act like it,” she said.</p> <p>Michelle Obama, speaking hours and countless disruptions later, seemed to draw a more positive response, eliciting applause during her lines on Clinton.</p> <p>“I’m with her,” Obama declared, asking Democrats to do for the former secretary of state what they did for her husband – and turn out to the polls.</p> <p>“Between now and November, we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago. … We need to get out every vote!” she said. “Let’s get to work.”</p> <p>The audience remained visibly divided during her remarks, however, with one man being shushed for saying, “We love you, Michelle.”</p> <p>Obama didn't leave the stage without taking a veiled shot at Trump. She warned that the White House couldn't be in the hands of someone with a ""thin skin or tendency to lash out or someone who tells voters the country could be great again.</p> <p>Booker, who had been considered for running mate before the job went to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, earlier blasted Republican nominee Donald Trump while touting Clinton’s support for a “fair wage” and “debt-free college” – and trying to connect her ideals to Sanders’.</p> <p>“It represents the best of our values, the best of our history and the best of our party -- all of our shared ideas and values together,” Booker said.</p> <p>Several celebrities including comedian Sarah Silverman and actress Eva Longoria also rallied to Clinton’s defense – with Silverman even taking on the Sanders crowd, saying, “Bernie or bust people, you’re being ridiculous.”</p> <p>Even before the disruptions in the arena, the convention had kicked off Monday under a cloud of controversy -- after the leak of emails indicating an anti-Bernie Sanders bias inside the DNC forced the resignation of Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p> <p>She had been expected to open the convention anyway, but after facing continued backlash from Sanders supporters Monday morning was replaced in that role by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.</p> <p>Anti-Clinton sentiment, however, continued to run high inside and outside the convention site, as pro-Sanders and other demonstrators marched from Camden to downtown Philadelphia and ultimately toward the arena – all while the convention was gaveling in.

A CNN/ORC survey gives Trump a 48-45 lead (44-39 with third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein included), a six-point improvement over the mogul’s performance in that outlet’s last survey earlier this month. It shows the support for Trump spiking among independents and non-college-educated white voters (where he has a remarkable 62-23 lead). A CBS poll showing Trump up by one point indicates a slight consolidation of Republican and conservative votes for Trump, and a spike in HRC’s unfavorables.

Putin’s Russia has been proven or credibly alleged to have boosted friendly candidates in France, Germany, Austria, and, most successfully, in the election of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine. Something like this seems to be happening in the American presidential election now. Several weeks ago, Franklin Foer wrote in Slate about the web of suspicious financial ties connecting Trump and his leading Russia adviser to the Kremlin. The story attracted little attention — maybe it was too far-fetched, or maybe the daily stream of cable-news ticker-friendly public outrages spewed out by Trump, which required no inference, blotted out a much deeper one that lay half-buried. But recent events have propelled the story into the presidential campaign.</p> <p>First, in Cleveland, Trump’s campaign, which had generally steered clear of platform disputes, threw around its weight to block a plank endorsing defensive military aide to Ukraine. Next, Trump shocked the foreign-policy Establishment by telling reporters that, contrary to decades of American policy, he might renege on America’s commitment to defend NATO allies in the event of a Russian invasion. And then, last weekend, emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been hacked by Russia appeared on WikiLeaks. The emails, which showed staffers pulling for Hillary Clinton despite the organization’s professed neutrality, created a rift between bitter supporters of Bernie Sanders and the party Establishment at a time when it was trying to tamp down discord in the service of concord. Clinton’s campaign manager is now stating openly that Russia is trying to help Trump.</p> <p>And oddly enough, the drama is having a second-order effect that is more profound than the direct hit from the email story. It is prying open a deep, decades-old ideological wedge between liberals and the left at just the moment when the two wings were seeking to form a united front against Trump.</p> <p>What is the relationship between Trump and Russia? That Russia is pulling for Trump is at this point beyond any dispute. The Kremlin’s English-language propaganda channel RT and Russia’s army of Twitter trolls, as well as Russia’s internal propaganda, have all thrown themselves behind the Republican candidate. A series of reports (here, here, and here) have shown that Russia backed the operation to hack the DNC. Adrien Chen, who reported last summer on Russia’s army of internet trolls that spreads disinformation abroad, noted in December that the trolls he was tracking had begun posing as pro-Trump conservatives.</p> <p>It is the other half of the equation that is more opaque. Putin is helping Trump, but what exactly is Trump giving him in return? As Foer notes, Trump’s habit of refusing to pay back people who loan him money means regular American banks won’t lend him money anymore, making him dependent on unusual sources of financing. He has cultivated deep personal and financial ties with Russia — and to do major business with Russia, unlike a reasonably free economy, is to do business with its ruling claque. Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, helped orchestrate Putin’s intervention in Ukraine. His Russia adviser Carter Page has deep ties to Russia and owns stock in Gazprom, the state-controlled firm that is a major source of the Kremlin’s financial and economic power. Michael Flynn, another Trump adviser, appears regularly on RT and refused to answer questions about whether he is paid to do so. Trump and Putin have exchanged lavish compliments.</p> <p>Trump’s own financial ties to Russia are completely non-transparent and will remain so as long as he refuses to release his tax returns. With a normal candidate, the Russia connection would amount to a massive, disqualifying scandal. At minimum, the nominee would face overwhelming pressure to release his tax return — a standard requirement even without grounds for suspicion — to prove he is not getting paid by a hostile foreign power. To be clear, it is pretty improbable that Trump is literally working for Putin. But this hardly settles the question. First, for a risk as consequential as the willful penetration of the American government by a hostile power, “pretty improbable” is not improbable enough. Second, the more likely explanation for the web of ties between Trump and Putin is still fairly damning. You have a candidate with a long record of admiring despots in general and the Russian despot in particular, surrounded by advisers in his pay, and who is flamboyantly ignorant of policy. Given these circumstances, it would be hard to imagine how Trump could form views on Russia without Putin’s influence.</p> <p>But the accusation that Trump’s relationship with Russia reeks of impropriety, in the media now by Clinton, has provoked a furious counterattack on the left. Even the indisputable notion that Russia is trying to help Trump (far from the more explosive charge that Trump is trying to help Russia) has been assailed on the left as “McCarthyism” by figures like Katrina vandenHeuvel, Glenn Greenwald, and many others.</p> <p>The split runs along the same lines as the fissure between liberals and leftists dating from the origins of the Cold War. The Cold War began under the presidency of Harry Truman, a figure who was regarded by progressives of his era with emotions ranging from disappointment to outright disgust. That dismay propelled the third-party candidacy of Henry Wallace, who attracted a small but wildly enthusiastic following among idealists and the far left. Wallace lambasted Truman as a warmonger, a tool of Wall Street and big business, and a traitor to the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt (which, to the frustration of liberals, had stalled). Wallace depicted the Marshall Plan, the Berlin Airlift, and other Cold War policies as a plot to instigate World War III.</p> <p>Photo: MPI</p> <p>The hostility between Truman and the left of his era, I argued a couple of months ago, parallels the current dynamic between Clinton and the Bernie Sanders movement today. The Trump-Russia scandal has activated that same left-wing impulse. The American far left during Truman’s era, just like today, was not pro-Russia so much as it was anti-anti-Russia, and follows identical themes: Criticism of Russia’s domestic repression or aggressive foreign policy is merely a ploy to distract from and excuse America’s own failings, and provides dangerous support for American aggression, which could lead to war. So, just as the left of the ‘40s and ‘50s saw anti-Stalinism as an excuse for Jim Crow, a Glenn Greenwald today casts Russia’s human-rights record in an implausibly favorable light, and reflexively dismisses any contrary view as simple hypocrisy. When Russia menaces Ukraine, The Nation informs its audience that this is perfectly justifiable because Ukraine is not really a country at all.</p> <p>Trump’s pro-Russia tilt has reenergized these Cold War tropes. The left-wing writer Corey Robin heartily endorses the Republican nominee’s statement that “When the world sees how bad the United States is and we start talking about civil liberties, I don’t think we are a very good messenger.” And in response to liberals aghast at Trump’s renunciation of upholding America’s commitment to NATO, Robin sneers at “the prospect of sending the US military off to fight Putin or whomever it is we’re now supposed to be willing to fight over NATO.” To clear up Robin’s apparent confusion, “whomever it is we’re now supposed to be willing to fight over NATO” is in fact whoever invades the members of NATO, all of whom are pledged to defend each other in the event of an attack. And “now” is in fact since NATO was formed in 1949.</p> <p>Obviously, there are sound foreign-policy reasons for caution in American foreign policy toward Russia. Ukraine is not a NATO member, which explains why Russian incursions have not been met with a military response. The defining trait of the left’s anti-anti-Russia stance is not a reluctance to go to war, but an automatic habit of analyzing Russia’s behavior through the prism of American innocence and motivations, which are inevitably found wanting.</p> <p>For whatever reason, Trump is the candidate who has given the most forthright expression to anti-anti-Russian beliefs of any candidate since circa 1948 Henry Wallace (just as he has given the most open expression of racist beliefs of any candidate since circa 1968 George Wallace). As the acrimony between Clinton-supporting liberals and their foes on the left spills out on the streets of Philadelphia, this historical irony is playing a minor role. The far left’s willingness to play into the opposing party’s hands displays not only its continued disgust with the Democratic Party’s nominee and Establishment, but a certain convergence of thought with the Republican nominee.</p> <p>Update: The Nation has an editorial denouncing defending Trump’s relationship with Russia, under the headline “Against Neo-McCarthyism.” The Nation’s in-house Russophile Stephen F. Cohen echoes those views. The editorial hinges upon a loose definition of “McCarthyism,” a term I would use to mean “false accusations of disloyalty,” but which The Nation uses to mean “any accusation of being in agreement with Russia, whether true or not.”</p> <p>The editorial asserts, “nobody has conclusively proven who hacked into the DNC’s network.” “Conclusive proof” is a pretty difficult standard, in the absence of a signed, notarized confession from Vladimir Putin. What we do have is the strong belief of experts both inside and outside the American government.</p> <p>The editorial likewise argues that poor Trump is being smeared because he wisely opposes arming Ukraine:</p> <p>To be sure, the GOP candidate has suggested that he may pursue a policy of détente with Russia. He also, in our view wisely, threw out a reckless plank in the Republican platform that pledged to further arm Kiev. But Trump is only following the lead of the current administration. Should we assert seditious links between President Obama’s policy and the Kremlin?</p> <p>The editorial fails to mention nearly all the disturbing evidence of Trump’s unusually deep ties to the Russian regime, including the financial ties between his advisers and the regime, Trump’s repudiation of NATO, extensive praise for Putin, and the drumbeat of pro-Trump propaganda from Russia’s media. Instead, the editorial assumes that any questioning of a politician’s ties to Russia is McCarthyism by definition.</p> <p>Inconveniently for The Nation, its anti-McCarthyism editorial seems to have been written before, but published after, the subject of its defense openly pleaded with Russia to violate American law on his behalf. The editorial laments, “liberal-media elites have joined with the Clinton campaign in promoting the narrative of a devious Russian cyber-attack.” Now Trump is also promoting this narrative – only, rather than calling it devious, it’s his actual policy.</p>","The opening was unruly, with the firing of the DNC Chairman and unruly Sanders supporters.

In that poll, 25 percent of Sanders supporters pledge their allegiance to either Green Party candidate Jill Stein or Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, when presented with those choices.</p> <p>The emails development — combined with Clinton’s selection of moderate Virginia senator Tim Kaine as her running mate — has injected new energy into Sanders’s most die-hard supporters, the ones who hope to (somehow) nominate the Vermont senator this week, or at least to ruin Clinton’s infomercial. The party has tried, unsuccessfully, to placate this faction, by bringing Florida congressperson (and Sanders nemesis) Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s tenure at the Democratic National Comittee to an untimely end.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the tightening polls suggest that, contrary to the conventional wisdom of a month ago, Clinton is going to need every last anti-Trump vote she can get this November.</p> <p>Crowd of Bernie delegates chanting ""We are the 1900,"" ""no fracked gas,"" ""bankers go to jail"" and a few other things near a meeting room — Kate Aronoff (@KateAronoff) July 25, 2016</p> <p>The dress rehearsal for that speech suggests these two goals may be mutually exclusive.</p> <p>“Immediately, right now, we have got to defeat Donald Trump,” Sanders said to hundreds of his delegates on Monday afternoon. “ And we have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.”</p> <p>The delegates enjoyed the first half of this message. They did not like the second.</p> <p>The crowd reacts to @BernieSanders saying: ""We have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine"" pic.twitter.com/7v3puhTdLM — POLITICO (@politico) July 25, 2016</p> <p>“Brothers and sisters, brothers and sisters, this is the real world that we live in,” Sanders continued.</p> <p>Moments after booing Sanders, the delegates rebutted his plea for realism with cheers, chanting, “We want Bernie! We want Bernie!”</p> <p>The socialist senator made clear that his invocation of the “real world” was not intended to discourage the crowd’s broader aspirations for radical change. Rather, Sanders argued that the tactic that was his presidential campaign has run its course. Now the movement must focus on keeping a dangerous demagogue out of the White House, while building strength on the local level.</p> <p>“Real politics is not necessarily sexy,” Sanders said. “You have heard me say a million times that this campaign is not just about electing a president, as important as that is … It is building a movement to transform this country. Election Days come and go, but the fight for social, economic, racial, and environmental justice continues.”</p> <p>It’s not clear whether this message will pacify the most committed Sandernistas within the senator’s delegation. Even if it doesn’t, their numbers might not be large enough to make their presence felt inside a Wells Fargo Center packed with Clinton-backers and more placid Sanders fans.

The Democrats are finally angry at Vladimir Putin and Russia because they think they’ve done something to help the real enemy, the Republican nominee.</p> <p>The New York Times points out that we’re living in topsy-turvy times, where the Democratic candidate is posing as the hawk against Russia and accusing the Republican nominee of being a stooge of Moscow:</p> <p>Even at the height of the Cold War, it was hard to find a presidential campaign willing to charge that its rival was essentially secretly doing the bidding of a key American adversary. But the accusation is emerging as a theme of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, as part of an attempt to portray Mr. Trump not only as an isolationist, but also as one who would go soft on confronting Russia as it threatens nations that have shown too much independence from Moscow or, in the case of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, joined NATO.</p> <p>Actually, flip the terms “rival” and “key American adversary.” They’re not charging that Trump is helping Russia; they’re charging that Russia is helping Trump.</p> <p>I’m old enough to remember when a “reset button” was going to make Putin’s Russia our friend!</p> <p>Good times, good times.</p> <p>The WikiLeaks hacking of the Democratic National Committee is terrible…but also delicious.</p> <p>Some of the revelations are not that surprising.</p> <p>It’s not surprising that Black Lives Matter activist and former Baltimore mayoral candidate DeRay Mckesson was vetted as a possible surrogate for the DNC.</p> <p>Donna Brazile was always fairly open about her preference for Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders, although it’s a little bit surprising to hear her discussing a desire to “cuss out the Sanders camp.”</p> <p>DNC staffers dismissing MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki as a “hipster pitbull”? Okay, I didn’t see that coming.</p> <p>Debbie Wasserman Schultz calling up Phil Griffin, MSNBC President, to complain after “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski called for Schultz to “step down”?

A vocal portion of the left is now aping the fantasy constructions of the right wing, showing themselves more focused on Hillary’s personal destruction than on any of the crucial issues at stake in November. Welcome to the Democratic National Convention.","<p>Photo: Jeff J Mitchell</p> <p>As the political focus moves from Cleveland to Philadelphia this week, there is hope among many Democrats that their convention can offer a positive, hopeful balm for last week’s nasty, brutish gathering and its distressing reliance on violent rhetoric. But there is also fear that the heightened anger and antipathy toward Clinton, which last week included calls for her imprisonment and extrajudicial punishment, could be contagious. This is especially disturbing because of where that rhetoric inevitably led last week: to suggestions that someone should do the candidate physical harm.</p> <p>The most widely reported of these calls was made last week by Donald Trump’s adviser, delegate, and New Hampshire state representative Al Baldasaro, who said in a radio interview that Clinton “should be put on the firing line and shot for treason.” Baldasaro explained that he saw Clinton’s executable offenses as being linked to the right-wing furor over the Benghazi attack and Clinton’s email server: “She is a disgrace for the lies that she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in Benghazi. She dropped the ball on over 400 emails requesting backup security.”</p> <p>This strain of fury was stoked by prime-time convention speakers including Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in the Benghazi raid. “For all of this loss, for all of this grief, for all of the cynicism the tragedy in Benghazi has wrought upon America, I blame Hillary Clinton,” Smith said. “I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son.” (Since then, the mother of Ambassador J. Christopher Stephens has publicly asked the Trump campaign to stop invoking her son’s death in such an “opportunistic and cynical” way.)</p> <p>Baldasaro didn’t back down, but later amplified his calls for Clinton’s death, noting in a follow-up interview with BuzzFeed that, “anyone that commits treason should be shot … I believe Hillary committed treason.” This time, it seems, he was referring to the email scandal, claiming that “when people take confidential material off a server, you’re sharing information with the enemy. That’s treason.”</p> <p>Baldasaro was not alone in his calls for the death of the candidate who’s about to be the first woman ever nominated by a major party for the presidency. Earlier in the week, Michael Folk, a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, had tweeted at Clinton, “You should be tried for treason, murder and crimes against the U.S. Constitution…then hung on the Mall in Washington, D.C.”</p> <p>As several people on Twitter pointed out, this use of the language of treason, even without explicit calls for execution, is far from anodyne. Five thousand copies of a flyer depicting John F. Kennedy as “Wanted for Treason,” and enumerating his sins, which included appointing anti-Christians to federal office and telling “fantastic LIES to the American people,” were distributed in Dallas, Texas, in the days before his 1963 assassination.</p> <p>The allegations of treason, lying, and criminality seem to offer moral cover to those who really, really hate Clinton, who hate her so much that their loathing can only be satisfied by fantasies about her violent and public demise. It allows her harshest critics to feel that their desire to hurt her stems from patriotism, perhaps to reassure themselves that their hate is not misogynistic but rather a commitment to moral, righteous justice.</p> <p>On Friday, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani gave a speech in which he reiterated the claim that Clinton is a “criminal,” running not for office but to try to avoid “an orange jumpsuit,” and that if Donald Trump becomes president, he will “reopen the case.” Then, moving on to her electoral prospects, he felt comfortable using this language about her chances at the polls: “Hillary, we’re going to kill you in upstate New York.” According to Politico, he raised his voice and added, “We’re going to take you out in New York.”</p> <p>The language of physical harm is catching. When NPR’s “The Takeaway” reported from Cleveland bars last Thursday night after Trump’s speech, they interviewed a GOP vice-chair who slurred, “We’re building coalitions of the Asians, of the Orthodox Jews, Italians, Irish,” before growling, “We’re gonna hurt her.” The “Takeaway” hosts were briefly taken aback but then laughed off how much these jubilant, aggressive hordes had had to drink.</p> <p>All of this is why it is particularly alarming, as the Democratic convention kicks off in Philadelphia, to see protesters on the left voice their dismay with Clinton using the same “Lock her up!” chants and signs that say, “Hillary for Prison.” It’s why it’s so disconcerting to hear Green Party candidate Jill Stein stoke those protesters convictions that Hillary is a lawbreaker by telling them, as she did on Sunday, that she will urge Bernie Sanders to withdraw his endorsement of Clinton “based on the outright, purposeful sabotage of your campaign by the DNC and by Hillary Clinton.”</p> <p>The left certainly has its own longstanding, legitimate beefs with the candidate — about her vote to invade Iraq; her hawkishness; her position on Palestine; her relationship to banks; her support of her husband’s 1990s legislation, including the crime bill and welfare reform; her tendency toward safe centrism, as seen in her decision to pick Tim Kaine as her running mate as opposed to Elizabeth Warren or Sherrod Brown. But none of these issues are what’s being invoked when crowds of purported lefties shout about unproven crimes, fraud, rigging, sabotage, or when they cheer for Clinton’s imprisonment.</p> <p>Some progressives are eager to turn the hacked DNC emails into a scandal that proves malfeasance that thereby delegitimizes primary results, but it does no such thing. In fact, the email hack, as embarrassing as it might be, provides ample evidence that there was no rigging of the primary process by the DNC. There were a bunch of people who worked for the Democratic Party who hated Sanders, who hadn’t been a member of the party for very long, and who was seriously challenging the party favorite. They didn’t do anything about it. The one guy who suggested, horribly, that they attack Sanders on his lack of faith got shot down. It should now be abundantly clear that there was no systematic conspiracy to rob Sanders of the Democratic nomination. (And if there had been, it certainly could not have been pulled off by an organization that cannot tell its ass from its elbow. The only good news in all this is that Deborah Wasserman Schultz, who was not good at her job, is no longer in charge of the DNC.)</p> <p>When RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, tweets that “our election was stolen, rigged” and that Wasserman Schultz was not “acting on her own”; when progressives cheer for WikiLeaks, which yesterday retweeted Ann Coulter’s racism and some anti-Semitism of its own; when Democrats are chanting “Lock her up!” the language and objectives of left and right become increasingly indistinguishable.</p> <p>This isn’t issues-based dismay over Hillary Clinton, and if it once were, it has transformed into something far more grotesque and dangerous. The merging of left-leaning political antagonism toward Hillary with the distortions of the right has left us here, with progressives — people who care deeply about our planet, about health care, about immigration, about minimum wage and police brutality and voting rights and reproductive rights and the future of the Supreme Court — heaping outsized condemnation not at the fascistic ogre who rose in Cleveland last week, but at the only person who realistically stands between him and his stewardship of this country.
