06851ed2-6ee5-4715-9d81-e8b522b864d8,Nancy Pelosi Didnât Cost Jon Ossoff the Election,The result left President Trump and other Republicans crowing and Democrats shaking their heads.,"<p>Photo: CLFSuperPAC/YouTube</p> <p>On Tuesday night, a 30-year-old Democrat with no electoral experience narrowly lost a special election in a deep red congressional district that he doesnât live in.</p> <p>Therefore, a number of Democrats and pundits have concluded that Nancy Pelosi should no longer be House minority leader.</p> <p>âI think youâd have to be an idiot to think we could win the House with Pelosi at the top,â Texas congressman Filemon Vela told Politico. âNancy Pelosi is not the only reason that Ossoff lost. But she certainly is one of the reasons.â</p> <p>It's just extremely difficult for Ds to argue benefits of Nancy Pelosi's fundraising skills still outweigh cost of her presence in GOP ads. â Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) June 21, 2017</p> <p>The reasoning here appears to be: If Nancy Pelosi werenât in the partyâs leadership, then it would have been impossible for Republicans to remind Trump-averse conservatives in the Atlanta exurbs that Jon Ossoff was a Democrat â and that liberals vote for Democrats.</p> <p>Itâs true that conservative groups spent a lot of money on ads tying Ossoff to Pelosi and her âSan Francisco values.â And thereâs no question that this culture-war theme did a lot of work for Karen Handelâs campaign: The Republican nominee refused to take a position on her partyâs deeply unpopular health-care bill â while her jobs message included firm opposition to the concept that full-time workers should be paid enough money to remain alive. Handel offered her constituents little beyond an opportunity to express their disgust for Godless liberals. And this proved to be more than sufficient.</p> <p>But it just doesnât follow that red Americaâs cultural resentments would lose their political potency the moment Pelosi ceded the throne. Yes, ads linked Ossoff to the minority leader â they also linked him to Kathy Griffin, black-block anarchists, and the guy that shot Steve Scalise.</p> <p>The Democrats are the party of liberals. Republicans will never have a hard time bringing this up in places where its inconveniant for Team Blueâs candidates. Nor will the party that turned a centrist technocrat into a sharia-socialist have trouble demonizing Pelosiâs successor.</p> <p>Happily, American public opinion is far more liberal than it is conservative. And there are more Democrats in the United States than there are Republicans. The problem is that the former just arenât that into voting. And replacing Pelosi with the last surviving blue dog Democrat would only make that problem worse.</p> <p>The Democratic Party should try to convert some Republican-leaning voters â but the ones whose amygdalae flare up when they think about a liberal woman from San Francisco holding a position of power are not among them. And itâs a little insane to think otherwise. Virtually every non-Democrat who is familiar with the words Nancy Pelosi is a member of the Republican base â imagine the GOP deciding in 2016 that its path back to power involved winning over voters who gag at the mention of John Boehner.</p> <p>Now, might there be a case for replacing Pelosi, regardless of the results of last nightâs election? Sure. The Democrats need to do more to cultivate their next generation of national leadership. And the partyâs approval rating is roughly as high as Donald Trumpâs â a rebrand couldnât hurt. If thereâs a charismatic, rising star in the House â who boasts the trust of the partyâs rising left-flank, a persona that appeals to independent voters in middle America, and an apparent talent for fundraising and legislative deal-making â then by all means, Pelosi should make way for the future.</p> <p>But if that future has yet to arrive, Democrats shouldnât pretend that it has for the sake of appealing to people who hate their partyâs base.</p>",Right,Left,X,Left

We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction,â Mr. Obama said.</p> <p>A 20-year-old gunman killed at least 10 students and wounded 20 others on the Umpqua campus Thursday. His identity and motive have not been revealed.</p> <p>In addition to blasting Congress, the president directed his anger at the gun lobby and the news media. He said he expects Second Amendment activists to again argue we need fewer gun laws, not more.</p> <p>âWe need more guns, theyâll argue, fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?â he said. âThere are scores of responsible gun owners in this country. They know thatâs not true.â</p> <p>SEE ALSO: Gun control debate at standstill despite agreement on restrictions for mentally ill</p> <p>On media coverage of mass shootings, Mr. Obama said news outlets should highlight that fewer Americans are killed by radical terrorists than by deranged gunmen in America.</p> <p>âI would ask news organizations â¦ tally up the number of Americans who have been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence and post those side by side,â he said.</p>",Right,Left,X,Right
17468554-cc61-4b0a-adc2-028d2e9b3be8,Obamacare Finally Gives Workers The Freedom Conservatives Demanded,Obamacare and Jobs,"<p>On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office projected that The Affordable Care Act will reduce the number of full-time workers by 2.3 million in 2021, leading critics to seize on the claim as evidence that the health care law is undermining job growth.</p> <p>But thatâs not what the CBO actually said. In fact, CBO economists write that â[t]he estimated reduction [in labor] stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businessesâ demand for labor.â Americans wonât be losing their jobs, but people who are only working to maintain access to their employer sponsored health insurance plans will be able to leave the workforce or work fewer hours because they can obtain coverage elsewhere. Thatâs a goal that prominent Republicans, conservative think tanks and policy analysts have supported for years:</p> <p>â âA lot of people change their jobs. So the tax benefit should change and go with them, and not be attached to their jobs. We want to address job lock. So, the key question that ought to be addressed in any health care reform legislation, is are we going to continue job lock, or are we going to allow individuals more choice, and portability to fit the 21st century workforce?â [Paul Ryan, 5/20/2009]</p> <p>â âToday, leaving a job or changing jobs means leavÂ­ing behind the health insurance provided at the place of work. Individuals who wish to take a better job, change careers, or leave the workforce to raise a family or to retire early take substantial risks. [â¦] Under the McCain plan, which links tax breaks directly to individuals instead of to their place of work, individuals would no longer feel obligated to stay with their employers simply because they need to keep their employer-based health insurance. [Heritage Foundation, 10/15/2008]</p> <p>â âOf course there are a number of things that I like in health care reform that Iâm going to put in placeâ¦. I also want individuals to be able to buy insurance, health insurance, on their own as opposed to only being able to get it on a tax advantage basis through their company.â [Mitt Romney, 9/9/2012]</p> <p>â â[T]he employer-based system leads to âjob lock,â whereby people are afraid to leave their jobs if they fall ill on the job, because switching plans could mean higher premiums or denial of coverage.â [Avik Roy, former health care adviser to Mitt Romney, 2/7/2012]</p> <p>In other words, ensuring that an older person who stays in a job for its health care coverage can retire sooner or that a mother can leave her job to take care of a sick child, or an entrepreneur can can quit secure employment and start a new business have long been bipartisan goals. Democrats have sought to give Americans more options though the health care lawâs exchanges and Medicaid expansion while Republican health care proposals focus on ending the favorable tax treatment of employer-sponsored health care and providing individuals with tax credits to buy their own health insurance on the individual market, across state lines.</p> <p>Academic research has quantified the cost of keeping health care coverage connected to the workplace. In 2008, researchers at Harvard estimated that there are â11 million people who would like to change jobs but are locked into their current job simply to keep their insurance,â while other studies have found that âjob-to-job mobility is estimated to increase by as much as 25 percent when alternative group coverage is available.â</p> <p>As Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) explained in 2008, while rolling out the health care proposal that animated his presidential campaign, ââjob lockâ reduces opportunities for American workers because they often pass up new jobs for fear of losing their health care coverage.â The health care law will start to change that predicament.</p> <p>Update:</p> <p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) who called the CBO findings âunrealâ has long been an advocate of disconnecting health care insurance from employment. As he wrote in 2013, âItâs common sense to recognize that Obamacare isnât working. We need to repeal it entirely, and instead reform federal law to expand choices and make health plans personal, portable and affordable.â</p>",Right,Left,X,Left

Did he go too far?,"<p>As Donald Trump and the father of a fallen Muslim U.S. soldier continued trading barbs on Monday morning, Hillary Clintonâs spat with the mom of an American who died in the Benghazi terror attack continues to take a back seat.</p> <p>The dustup between the Republican presidential nominee and Khizr Khan has gotten the headlines, but some are beginning to wonder why equal time isnât being given to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has challenged Pat Smithâs claims that Clinton told her the Benghazi attack started because of an anti-Muslim video. That origin story has since been proved false and emails sent by Clinton soon after the attack show the then-Secretary of State was aware the Sept. 11, 2012 assault was a coordinated terror strike.</p> <p>âWhy was Pat Smithâs grief minimized?â Trump pollster and senior advisor Kellyanne Conway told Bloomberg Politics on Sunday. âMedia cover this election as a referendum on Trump while voters see it as a referendum on Hillary. That wonât change votersâ perspective.â</p> <p>Meanwhile right-leaning sites such as Town Hall have published headlines blaring âHave we forgotten that Hillary Clinton pretty much called a Gold Star Mother a liar?â</p> <p>Smith, the mother of Foreign Service officer Sean Smith, made a passionate speech at the Republican National Convention two weeks ago, mournfully remembering her dead son and laying the blame for his murder at Clintonâs feet. Pat Smith has repeatedly said Clinton blamed the anti-Muslim video for inspiring the Benghazi attacks, a charge Clinton has denied.</p> <p>âSince then, I have repeatedly asked Hillary Clinton to explain to me the real reason why my son is dead,â Smith said during her RNC speech. âIâm still waiting.â</p> <p>But Clinton said during a Sunday interview on âFox News Sundayâ that Smith must not have correctly remembered their conversation during the 2012 ceremony.</p> <p>âAs other members of families who lost loved ones have said, thatâs not what they heard,â Clinton said. âI donât hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall everything that was or wasnât said.â</p> <p>Clintonâs response is nothing new. During a March Democratic debate, Clinton said of Smith, âI canât imagine the grief she has about losing her son. But sheâs wrong. Sheâs absolutely wrong.â</p> <p>But the Clinton-Smith back-and-forth has seen little coverage as opposed to the attention given to the aftermath of Khanâs Thursday speech at the Democratic National Convention, when the father of dead soldier Capt. Humayun Khan rebuked Trump for his proposed Muslim immigration ban.</p> <p>Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice! â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2016</p> <p>The squabble between Trump and Khan has morphed into a multi-day drama as Khan has continued appearing on news shows criticizing Trump and Trump has responded via his Twitter account, TV interviews and official campaign statements. Khan has said Trump is a âblack soulâ and Trump has responded that Khan had âno rightâ to criticize him on a national stage.</p> <p>The public quarrel has drawn strong reactions from many top Republicans, who have praised Capt. Khanâs sacrifice and scolded Trump for his rhetoric. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., delivered a stinging critique on Monday morning, saying that âwhile our Party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us.â</p>",Left,Right,X,Right

340bccc6-4647-431e-9a18-d133f755739b,Ohio State Fake News Study Doesnât Say What The Media Thinks It Says,"A new study suggests that fake news had a significant impact on the 2016 election, so much so that it may have given President Trump a pathway to win. The Left argued that the data shows a high probability that false stories cost Clinton the election, while the Right highlighted other studies that concluded fake news had little to no effect on the outcome.","<p>The Washington Postâs Aaron Blake circulated a problematic study Tuesday that allegedly suggests fake news might have been the deciding factor for President Donald Trumpâs victory in the 2016 election.</p> <p>Researchers at the Ohio State University concluded that âfake news most likely did have a substantial impact on the voting decisions of a strategically important set of voters â those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012.â</p> <p>The study focuses on the voting behavior of 585 respondents from a sample of 1,600 who originally voted for former President Barack Obama in 2012 and then asked the group 281 questions âthat included, in addition to the standard election-survey items, three fake news statements.â</p> <p>WATCH DAN RATHER ON FAKE NEWS:</p> <p>Such statements included âHillary Clinton is in very poor health due to a serious illness,â which 12 percent of former Obama supporters said was âdefinitely trueâ or âprobably true;â âPope Francis endorsed Donald Trump for president prior to the election,â which eight percent supported; and âDuring her time as U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton approved weapon sales to Islamic jihadists, including ISIS,â which 20 percent of Obama voters agreed with.</p> <p>From these numbers, the researchers extrapolated that the âpernicious pollution of our political discourse was sufficient to influence the outcome of what was a very close election.â</p> <p>Such a conclusion comes with a number of caveats. For starters, the researchers themselves acknowledge that âgiven the inability to determine temporal order in a single-wave cross-sectional survey, we cannot prove that belief in fake news âcausedâ these former Obama voters to defect from the Democratic candidate in 2016.â WaPoâs piece on the study is headlined âA new study suggests fake news might have won Donald Trump the 2016 election.â</p> <p>Moreover, the respondents agreed with fake statements after they voted. This carries the possibility they are simply justifying their 2016 choice.</p> <p>There is also no evidence that the fake statements or rumors used in the study were from foreign sources like Russia. Americans are perfectly capable of creating false stories on their own without outside interference.</p> <p>The researchers donât have any evidence that these voters werenât going to vote for Trump under any circumstances. Itâs possible that many of these crossover voters felt better about their choice after learning Clinton had some sort of debilitating illness, but itâs unlikely that such a rumor would negate a votersâ policy preferences.</p> <p>A Stanford and New York University study concluded in 2017 that any so-called âfake newsâ stories likely had zero to minimal impact on the electionâs outcome. The authors concluded:</p> <p>âIf one fake news article were about as persuasive as one TV campaign ad, the fake news in our database would have changed vote shares by an amount on the order of hundredths of a percentage point. This is much smaller than Trumpâs margin of victory in the pivotal states on which the outcome depended.â</p> <p>Follow Joe on Twitter.</p>",Right,Left,X,Right

His key point â one he reiterated in his tweet announcing the decision â is this:</p> <p>We should not be content to pass health care legislation on a party-line basis, as Democrats did when they rammed Obamacare through Congress in 2009. If we do so, our success could be as short-lived as theirs when the political winds shift, as they regularly do. The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.</p> <p>Fine, but if so, what was literally all of this about? Itâs been clear since early this year, when Democrats rebuffed the original Cassidy-Collins bill, that no Democrat would support a repeal or deep reform of Obamacare.

Many publications have noted that this likely means the bill is dead and will not move forward. McCain said in a statement that he, ""cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,"" as it had not gone through a bipartisan, rigorous debate process.","<p>Photo-Illustration: Photo-Illustration: Konstantin Sergeyev/Daily Intelligencer. Photos: Getty Images</p> <p>Senate Republicans know very little about what their new health-care plan would actually do. This is because the billâs primary author left the Senate in 2006, and the legislation he wrote has been public for all of eight days. âIf there was an oral exam on the contents of the proposal, graded on a generous curve, only two Republicans could pass it,â a senior Republican aide told a reporter this week â before stipulating that the billâs putative co-author, Lindsey Graham, was not one of them.</p> <p>But you need not take an anonymous aideâs word on it. On Tuesday, Voxâs Jeff Stein asked nine GOP senators what problems the Graham-Cassidy health-care bill solves, and how it solves them. The lawmakers responded with platitudes about federalism, the phrase âread the bill and youâll understand,â and a bizarre reference to the final scene of Thelma and Louise.</p> <p>Still, Republicans know a few things about their latest iteration of Trumpcare. They know that the bill reforms one-sixth of the American economy so radically the Congressional Budget Office will need weeks to generate a detailed analysis of its likely effects; that every major health-care-industry stakeholder â from doctors and patients and hospitals to insurers and medical charities â opposes the legislation; that seven of their own partyâs governors also oppose it; that health-care-policy analysts believe the bill would make health insurance unaffordable for many people with preexisting conditions; that it would radically reduce Medicaid and federal subsidies for health insurance; and that some analysts say those cuts would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 32 million over the next decade.</p> <p>And yet, according to reports, at least 48 Republican senators are ready to vote for the bill next week. Which raises the question: Why is almost every GOP senator ready to vote for widely reviled legislation that they do not understand?</p> <p>The popular answer is that they feel a political obligation to make good on their promises to the conservative base, regardless of the implications for public policy. Remarkably, several senators have stated, explicitly, that this is their calculus.</p> <p>âYou know, I could maybe give you ten reasons why this bill shouldnât be considered,â Iowaâs Chuck Grassley told reporters in his state Wednesday. âBut Republicans campaigned on this so often that you have a responsibility to carry out what you said in the campaign. Thatâs pretty much as much of a reason as the substance of the bill.â</p> <p>Senators are not supposed to support legislation that they believe to be unworthy of consideration on substantive grounds just because they promised their voters that they would support a bill of that general type. The entire point of having a republic â as opposed to a direct democracy â is that the former enables elected representatives to exercise independent judgement in policy-making.</p> <p>Still, as contemptible as Grassleyâs official rationale for supporting Graham-Cassidy is, his partyâs actual motivation for pushing the bill is (almost certainly) more sinister. In truth, Graham-Cassidy does not fulfill the Republican Partyâs promises to its voters â and there is virtually no evidence that said voters would punish the party for failing to pass it. The bill does, however, advance the priorities of the GOPâs big-dollar donors â and there is significant evidence that they would punish the Republican lawmakers if the legislation fails.</p> <p>Itâs true that Republicans have spent nearly a decade promising voters that they would ârepeal and replace Obamacare.â But most Republicans specifically promised to replace the law with one that would make health-care benefits more generous and universally affordable. Our Republican president promised to preserve Medicaid in its current form and achieve universal coverage with lower deductibles. The mogul even went so far as to explicitly disavow the conservative movementâs traditional hostility to the welfare state, telling 60 Minutes, âThere was a philosophy in some circles that if you canât pay for it, you donât get it. Thatâs not going to happen with us.â</p> <p>Trump wasnât the only one singing such a tune. Virtually all of the GOPâs leading lights attacked Obamacare from the left, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who lamented in January, âThere are 25 million Americans who arenât covered now â¦ And many Americans who actually did get insurance â when they did not have it before â have really bad insurance that they have to pay for, and the deductibles are so high that itâs really not worth much to them.â</p> <p>McConnell, Trump, and their co-partisans pretended to support a more generous government health program for a reason: That is what most Republican voters want. Earlier this year, a Morning Consult survey found that a majority of conservatives â and a large plurality of self-identified tea-party supporters â thought that âthe government should spend more on health care.â</p> <p>Turns out Tea Party voters want more government healthcare spending, yet support Ryan's healthcare bill. Go figure. https://t.co/y77gXZHn6j pic.twitter.com/VT7W2FqDPC â Guy Kawasaki (@GuyKawasaki) March 23, 2017</p> <p>Those findings are consistent with polling from Pew Research, which back in May found 61 percent of Republican voters saying that government funding levels for health care should be maintained or increased. Meanwhile, according to a recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 12 percent of all U.S. adults support cuts to Medicaid (which happens to be about the percentage of the public that supported the Senateâs previous Medicaid-gutting, Obamacare-repeal bill).</p> <p>Graham-Cassidy would cut federal spending on insurance subsides and the Medicaid expansion by an estimated $243 billion between 2020 and 2026. That is neither what Republicans campaigned on, nor what their constituents want.</p> <p>But it is what their most affluent donors want â or at least they believe it moves the ball in their desired direction. While Republican voters are broadly supportive of Medicaid â and many GOP senators from Medicaid-expansion states have touted their support for the policy â the conservative donor network funded by the oil billionaires Charles and David Koch has been unequivocal in its opposition to the federal program.</p> <p>âOur network voraciously opposed Medicaid expansion in state after state,â Tim Phillips, head of the Koch-funded nonprofit Americans for Prosperity, told GOP donors at the Koch Networkâs June retreat. âThese Republicans who expanded Medicaid were flatly wrong. So weâre going to continue holding these Republicans accountable.â</p> <p>At the same retreat, the Koch brothers themselves complained that the Republican health-care bill â which, at the time, already included significant cuts to Medicaid â was insufficiently conservative. That bill failed, amid widespread public opposition to its austerity. Senate Republicans responded by drafting a new iteration of Trumpcare that cuts Medicaid â and subsidies for health insurance â even more severely.</p> <p>In voting for Graham-Cassidy, Republican senators might fulfill promises they made to Charles Koch in Colorado Springs. But most would actually be breaking their promises to voters. Multiple GOP senators pledged to vote against any bill that failed to preserve protections for people with preexisting conditions, address the opioid crisis, or reduce insurance premiums.</p> <p>Graham-Cassidy fails to do all of these things. In fact, its scheme for block-granting federal health-care spending to the states is so haphazard and ill-thought-out, it would lead insurers to drastically increase their premiums, so as to protect themselves against market uncertainty.</p> <p>The notion that Republicans need to pass a bill that will increase the cost of health insurance â and break a variety of substantive promises to their constituents â for the sake of political expediency is bizarre. The only evidence for this view is that Republican voters still support âObamacare repeal.â But if GOP lawmakers want to vote for a health-care bill that breaks their substantive promises to voters â and call it âObamacare repealâ â they have better options.</p> <p>Days ago, Senate Democrats offered to support waivers that would allow red states to opt out of some Obamacare regulations, in exchange for funding to shore up the exchanges. This legislation would have averted a significant spike in insurance premiums next year â and, in keeping federal funding for health-care constant, it would have been closer to the substantive wishes of GOP voters than Graham-Cassidy is. Whatâs more, some Democrats were prepared to let President Trump call the measure âObamacare repeal.â</p> <p>There is no reason to believe that the GOPâs political interests would be better served by passing a radical bill that will increase health-insurance premiums than by passing a bipartisan one that will reduce them â unless one stipulates that doing the latter would alienate big-dollar donors. Trump voters overwhelmingly approved of the presidentâs bipartisan debt-ceiling deal â and independents appear to have been even more enthusiastic.</p> <p>The GOP base is not allergic to bipartisanship and compromise, so long as itâs their champion whoâs making the deals. But the Koch brothers are. The Kochs do not oppose Obamacare because the program doesnât work well enough â they oppose it because they find it morally wrong for the state to take money from wealthy people and use it to subsidize health insurance for non-wealthy people. Thus, technocratic fixes that make government-subsidized health care work better are antithetical to their project. Their interest is not in improving the Affordable Care Act, but in discrediting the premise on which it is based: that redistributive government programs can improve health care for most Americans.</p> <p>And the Kochs and their ilk have made clear that Republicans who buck them will face consequences. This week, NBC Newsâ Kasie Hunt tweeted, âRepublicans heard loud & clear from donors this August that do-nothing isnât going to cut it.â At the Koch retreat in June, at least one major donor threatened to close âthe Dallas piggy bankâ until repeal was passed. In August, one Republican donor responded to the apparent death of Obamacare repeal by actually suing the party for fraud.</p> <p>Republicans donât need donations from billionaires more than they need the votes of their base. But the former pay far closer attention to the details of policy. On fiscal matters, it is much riskier for Republicans to buck their donors than to betray the constituents who elected them.</p> <p>Senate Republicans are on the cusp of radically reforming our health-care system in ways that they do not fully understand â and that industry stakeholders and GOP voters broadly oppose â out of fear that a few dozen obscenely wealthy libertarians will evict them from Congress if they donât.</p> <p>If Graham-Cassidy becomes law, our nation will enter a health-care crisis. But the fact that 40-something senators would vote for the bill, today, means that we have already entered a democratic one.</p>",Left,Right,X,Left

Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) much-anticipated speech Wednesday night had the usual bromides and warm, biographical details typically found in remarks at political conventions.</p> <p>It also had several demonstrably misleading assertions.</p> <p>For example, Ryan said that while campaigning for president in 2008, Barack Obama said a General Motors plant in Janesville, Wis., would not shut down.</p> <p>""That plant didnât last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And thatâs how it is in so many towns today, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight,"" Ryan said.</p> <p>The plant did end up closing -- in December 2008. When George W. Bush was president. The decision to close the plant was made in June 2008.</p> <p>Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney's campaign, defended the vice presidential candidate's remarks in an interview with CNN's ""Starting Point"" on Tuesday.</p> <p>""[H]e didnât talk about Obama closing the plant, he said candidate Obama went there in 2008 and what he said was with government assistance, we can keep this plant open for another 100 years,"" argued Fehrnstrom. ""Here are we are four years into his administration; that plant is still closed. I think it's a symbol of the recovery that hasn't materialized for the people of Janesville, Wis., just as it hasn't materialized for Americans everywhere.""</p> <p>When Obama visited the plant in February 2008, he said, ""I believe if our government is there to support you, and give you the assistance you need to retool and make this transition, that this plant will be here for another hundred years.""</p> <p>Ryan also has shifted his rhetoric slightly when talking about the GM plant, allowing him to mince his words while arguing that he's not technically inaccurate.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Ryan was a bit less careful, saying, ""I remember President Obama visiting it when he was first running, saying he'll keep that plant open. One more broken promise.""</p> <p>CNN John Berman also asked Fehrnstrom on Thursday why Ryan blasted Obama for the failure of the Simpson-Bowles debt commission -- when the congressman was one of the Republicans who voted against the commission's recommendations.</p> <p>""He created a bipartisan debt commission,"" said Ryan in his speech Wednesday. ""They came back with an urgent report. He thanked them, sent them on their way, and then did exactly nothing. Republicans stepped up with good-faith reforms and solutions equal to the problems. How did the president respond? By doing nothing -- nothing except to dodge and demagogue the issue.""</p> <p>""[Ryan] stood in the way of the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission, and then criticized the president for not taking action on it,"" noted Berman.</p> <p>Fehrnstrom argued that the point was irrelevant, since Ryan later put out his own budget plan.</p> <p>""There can be disagreements about how to reduce the deficit and how to put the budget on a path to fiscal balance. The important thing is, what is your plan? He brought it forward,"" replied Fehrnstrom.</p> <p>Watch the full video below:</p>",Right,Left,X,Left

Marco Rubio attacked frontrunner Donald Trump over his for-profit school thatâs been accused of scamming students. But Rubio doesnât have much ground to stand on when it comes to criticizing for-profit colleges.</p> <p>So-called Trump University began operating in 2005, though it did not have an actual campus or offer actual degrees. Instead, it sold expensive CDs and DVDs and offered seminars promising students would learn how to make money in real estate. Students of Trumpâs âuniversityâ are now pursuing a civil lawsuit accusing Trump University of fraud. The trial could begin sometime in May.</p> <p>At Thursdayâs debate, Rubio slammed Trump University for being a âfake schoolâ that only left students with a âcardboard cutout of Donald Trump.â</p> <p>âThere are people that borrowed $36,000 to go to Trump University and they are suing him now,â Rubio said.</p> <p>Although students paid thousands of dollars for Trump seminars, Rubioâs hands are not clean either, since he has supported a for-profit college chain that has hurt far more students than Trump University has. Corinthian Colleges, which actually offered degrees and was regionally accredited, damaged far more studentsâ lives.</p> <p>Although 80,000 people attended Trump Universityâs free introductory seminars, only 9,200 paid the $1,495 for three-day seminars and as few as 800 people paid thousands of dollars for the universityâs mentorship and workshop packages, according to the Washington Post. But as many as 350,000 students who borrowed to attend Corinthian Collegesâ schools could benefit from student loan forgiveness from the federal government for being victims of fraud from the college chain.</p> <p>Instead of encouraging the government to investigate the for-profit college chain, Rubio asked for leniency in a letter to the U.S. Department of Education in the summer of 2014. The letter, which was obtained by Bloomberg Politics, read, in part, âWhile I commend the Departmentâs desire to protect our nationâs students from fraudulent and malicious activity by any institution of higher education, regardless of tax status, I believe the Department can and should demonstrate leniency as long as Corinthian Colleges, Inc. continues to expeditiously and earnestly cooperate by providing the documents requested.â</p> <p>Rubio has also accepted $27,600 in contributions from Corinthian Colleges throughout the past five years, Bloomberg reported. The last donation for $2,700 was filed on April 30 of last year.</p> <p>Last year, Corinthian Colleges shut down its remaining 28 campuses, leaving 16,000 students without a college, shortly after the Department of Education fined the company $30 million for falsifying job-placement rates. For example, a student whose field of study was accounting was counted as having found a job in her field when in reality she was doing food service at Taco Bell.</p> <p>In an interview with ThinkProgress last fall, Jessica King, a 33-year-old single mother who attended Everest College and now works as a bartender, said she doesnât think continuing her education is possible due to over $30,000 in debt sheâs still paying off. âAt this point, Iâd love to be able to go back to school and get a degree and my finish up my hopes and my dreams, but I think Everest robbed me of that but the department of education robbed me of that,â King said.</p>",Right,Left,X,Left

Did he go too far?,"<p>The embattled parents of the fallen Sergeant Khan want to get away from the feud that started when they attacked Republican nominee Donald Trump on the stage of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) last week.</p> <p>âWe want to be out of this controversy. That is not our styleâ¦This is not our path,â father Khizr Khan told CNN Monday. Khan attempted to preempt any Trump response by saying there was no need for Trump to comment any more on the matter. âWe want to maintain our dignity,â Khan added.</p> <p>Trump responded to Khan on Twitter.</p> <p>Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same â Nice! â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2016</p> <p>Trump immediately attempted to shift the narrative to terrorism in his next tweet.</p> <p>This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart! â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2016</p> <p>The Khan family used their time at the DNC to attack Trump for his comments on Muslims in America, and to give him a lesson on the Constitution. Khizr Khan also said that Trump has never had to make the sacrifices that people like his son do on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>Trump responded the next day in an interview on ABC, saying, âI think Iâve made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard.â Trump went on to insist that Khanâs wife didnât speak at the DNC because of her Islamic faith. âIf you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasnât allowed to have anything to say. You tell me.â</p> <p>Republican leadership refused to defend Trumpâs attacks on the Khan family. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan made an official statement on the matter, saying, âAmericaâs greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it. As I have said on numerous occasions, a religious test for entering our country is not reflective of these fundamental values. I reject it.â</p> <p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, former Governors Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, all came out against Trumpâs statements, and affirmed the respect they have for families of fallen soldiers.

7ec0a751-097c-4862-9ebb-dec241a2431a,This Might Be the Worst Democratic Freak-out Ever,The result left President Trump and other Republicans crowing and Democrats shaking their heads.,"<p>Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</p> <p>Karen Handelâs close-but-not-that-close win in Georgiaâs sixth district, the fourth Republican victory in four special elections, has officially made the partyâs failure to capture a House seat in 2017 a capital-T Thing. âLetâs be clear: something ainât working for Democrats, party insiders privately tell us,â reports Politico Playbook. Representative Ro Khanna, sounding like an upset fan calling into a sports talk radio show, called for the party to âfire its consultantsâ and replace them with three of his favorite opinion journalists. âDeep down [Democrats] know they needed â and still need â a win in a high-profile race in which the fight was between Trump/Republicans and Pelosi/Democrats,â writes Chris Cillizza. âThere are no moral victories in politics. No matter what the losing side says â and they always say this â the only thing that really matters when it comes to special elections is the âWâ and the âL.ââ</p> <p>Itâs certainly true that Jon Ossoffâs underperformance of the polls (he was nearly tied in the polling average, and is losing by almost 4 points) should incrementally adjust oneâs view of the Democratsâ prospects. But the reason the party has lost all four special elections is glaringly simple. It is not some deep and fatal malady afflicting its messaging, platform, consultants, or ad spending allocation methods. Republicans have won the special elections because theyâve all been held in heavily Republican districts.</p> <p>The special elections exist because Donald Trump appointed Republicans in Congress to his administration, carefully selecting ones whose vacancy would not give Democrats a potential opening. It feels like Democrats somehow canât win, but that is entirely because every contest has been held on heavily Republican turf.</p> <p>The overall measure of Democratsâ standing at the moment is not whether they have won, but how they have performed relative to the partisan composition of the districts in which they are running. That gauge remains quite positive. As Dave Wasserman points out, in the four special elections, they have overperformed the partisan baseline in their districts by an average of 8 percentage points:</p> <p>If that performance holds up in the midterm elections, it would be enough to make Democrats solid favorites to win a House majority. (The undemocratic makeup of the House map means Democrats need to increase their votes by some 6â7 percent in order to gain a majority. Of course, since the midterms donât take place for more than a year, things could change in either direction. President Trump might change course and pass a popular domestic initiative, or benefit from a foreign crisis, or some kind of racialized conflict provoked by his draconian law-enforcement policies.</p> <p>On the other hand, Trumpâs standing could well deteriorate between now and then, given that the only crises he has faced so far are ones heâs created, and his managerial prowess has not exactly inspired confidence. In 2009, Democrats not only won four straight special elections to replace departing House Democrats, they also flipped a House seats from a retiring Republican. Imagine how despondent Democrats would feel if they lost a Democratic seat with Trump in office. At the time, Democrats saw the victory as evidence that they were safe from a midterm wave. âThis election represents a double blow for national Republicans and their hopes of translating this summerâs âtea partyâ energy into victories at the ballot box,â crowed the Democratsâ House campaign chairman. As it turned out, the situation deteriorated pretty badly over the next year.</p> <p>So what accounts for the deep gloom overtaking Democrats? There are the atmospherics of repeatedly losing, which overpower any circumstantial explanation. There is also a long-standing party division over tactics, which gives all sides an incentive to play up the direness of defeat in order to emphasize their own customary remedies. (âMy strategy will make our party stronger, but weâre doing fine anywayâ is an argument nobody in history has ever made.) And then there is the psychology of surprise. A few months ago, a 4-point Ossoff defeat would have met expectations. After a frenzied nationalized race, it comes as a massive blow, which requires explanations large enough to bear the weight of the trauma it has inflicted upon Democrats.</p> <p>Matthew Ygelsiasâs take on Ossoffâs defeat urges Democrats to change course, citing, among other models, âJeremy Corbynâs surprisingly strong showing.â Corbyn, of course, lost his race, just as Ossoff did. And Corbyn, unlike Ossoff, ran nationally (rather than in a heavily conservative district) and faced a deeply discredited incumbent. An average Labour nominee not encumbered by Corbynâs left-wing baggage would probably have won a clear victory. But since Corbyn did lose by less than he had been expected to a few weeks before, momentum transmuted his narrow defeat into a galvanizing victory, just as it transmuted Ossoffâs narrow defeat into a debacle.</p> <p>The final reason for the overreaction is that everybody has priced irrationality into the system. That is, even people who know perfectly well that a swing of a few points one way or another in a single race tells very little about national conditions expect other people to overreact. It is quite possible that Handelâs victory will encourage nervous Republicans to continue holding the line for Trumpâs unpopular agenda. But, to the extent the race increases the odds of Congress passing a health-care bill that polls below 20 percent, it would raise, not lower, the chance that Democrats make midterm gains. (Not that many Democrats would take that trade-off.) The irrational-response factor helps rather than hinders Democrats.</p> <p>But perhaps the better response is to take irrationality for granted, and start to act â¦ rational?</p>",Left,Right,X,Left
8662fb3a-a8c3-4be5-82d2-a0d6d7eed3ff,"The Las Vegas Shooter Passed Background Checks, Had Ammonia Nitrate in His Car","Many politicians, members of the media, and other public figures are offering condolences as well as opinions in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 58 dead and 500 others injured in Las Vegas Sunday night. Many people on the Left are calling for stricter gun legislation and for Congress to act quickly in response to the shooting. Conversely, many on the Right are saying that the event should not be politicized until all information has been acquired and the dust has settled.","<p>Itâs still unclear exactly what the shooter in Las Vegas used to carry out his disgusting attack last night. By all accounts, he had so many weapons that itâll be a while before we know which ones he chose. Nevertheless, two new pieces of evidence have come to light in the last few hours, and both give us a little insight into who he was and what he was hoping to achieve. The first piece of news is that the killer âpassed all required federal background checksâ on at least two recent occasions:</p> <p>Two Nevada gun shops confirmed Monday that they sold firearms to Mandalay Bay shooter Stephen Paddock in the last year and said he passed all required background checks. It was unknown if the weapons Paddock bought from the gun shops, New Frontier Armory in North Las Vegas and from Guns and Guitars in Mesquite, were used in the casino massacre.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>This doesnât mean that the shooter didnât have an automatic weapon as well, although if he did, as opposed to a Gatling crank or a bump fire system that increased the rate of fire on his semi-automatic rifles, heâd have had to obtain it separately and at great effort and cost. (Automatic weapons are extremely expensive â on both the black market and the legal market â and they can only be obtained after the buyer has paid a hefty tax and passed a rigorous and long-lasting federal check.) And it doesnât mean that the weapons that he bought on these occasions were used in the shooting. What it does mean, however, is that he wasnât a felon â or, at least, that there was nothing in the federal database that would have prevented him from buying weapons. That matters, because we are already hearing politicians pretend that âuniversal background checksâ would have prevented this attack. They wouldnât have.</p> <p>The second is that, per the sheriff of the Las Vegas Police Department, the shooter had âammonia nitrateâ in his car. Given the peculiar sophistication of this attack â David French wrote about that earlier â one can only begin to wonder what else he had planned. As far as I understand, ammonia nitrate is an ingredient in what weâd call a âfertilizer bomb.â For whatever reason, this person was serious and he was prepared. Hopefully weâll soon have some idea of his motive.</p>",Right,Left,X,Right
a67eb9b6-aeda-4688-b571-19d4a0877d78,Ossoff & Handel: Planned Parenthood Spending Falls Short,The result left President Trump and other Republicans crowing and Democrats shaking their heads.,"<p>Itâs difficult to determine who ended up as the biggest loser in yesterdayâs special election in Georgiaâs sixth district. The most obvious choice is Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff, who, despite raising an historic $23 million in campaign funding, could not bring home the victory for his party last night.</p> <p>The Democratic party itself was another dud in Georgiaâs sixth. After months of spinning this race as an entirely winnable one â and a referendum on the early days of Donald Trumpâs presidency â the party and its advocates are once again being forced to reexamine their strategies and their appeal to American voters.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>But one outside group was dealt a particularly heavy blow in Ossoffâs stunning defeat last night: Planned Parenthood. The groupâs political-activism arm poured nearly $735,000 into the Democratâs campaign, a contribution that was topped only by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</p> <p>After the results came in last night, Planned Parenthood immediately shifted the narrative, attempting to justify its obscene spending levels by portraying the race as some of kind of moral victory. This claim is an exercise in blatant goalpost-moving. Progressives, Planned Parenthood included, insisted throughout that Ossoff had the potential to turn Georgia blue. A loss does no such thing.</p> <p>Planned Parenthoodâs activist rhetoric was clearly lacking as well. The abortion group was the campaignâs biggest purveyor of the fiction that Ossoffâs opponent, Republican Karen Handel, had intentionally deprived women of essential health care by severing ties with Planned Parenthood when she served as a vice president for the Susan G. Komen Foundation. But Handel wasnât the instigator of that policy change; the foundation had considered it for over a decade, largely due to Komen donorsâ concerns that their gifts might indirectly fund abortion.</p> <p>By tacking a $735,000 price tag onto Ossoffâs failed effort, Planned Parenthood has revealed its own futility at influencing elections. That failure underscores another important point. Planned Parenthood consistently argues that, if it were to be stripped of its federal funding, millions of women would lose âvital health care.â</p> <p>If money is really so tight over at Planned Parenthood â and if American women are truly in desperate need of life-saving care that they canât get anywhere else â perhaps the abortion-rights group should think twice before dropping hundreds of thousands on insignificant political races, whether or not those races end in bitter defeat.</p>",Left,Right,X,Right

b15c6666-e7fa-4078-8bad-0104714ace6b,Obamacare will push 2 million workers out of labor market: CBO,Obamacare and Jobs,"<p>Obamacare will push the equivalent of about 2 million workers out of the labor market by 2017 as employees decide either to work fewer hours or drop out of the job market altogether, according to estimates released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office.</p> <p>The analysis set off a furious debate in Washington. The White House argued that the reduction is positive because it means Americans will forgo jobs or extra work to stay home with their children or strike out on their own as entrepreneurs. Republicans, however, said the report amounted to an âI told you soâ moment and that subtracting the equivalent of 2 million workers canât be good for the economy.</p> <p>The CBO said the number of workers dropping out of the labor force will grow from 2 million in 2017 to 2.5 million by 2024.</p> <p>Although part of those numbers are attributed to job cuts, the vast majority represent workers who decide it makes more sense to stay home or work fewer hours, weighing the higher taxes they pay in the workforce versus their qualifications for benefits if they drop out.</p> <p>âCBO estimates that the ACA will reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 to 2 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor â given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive,â the nonpartisan tax agency said in its economic outlook.</p> <p>The CBO also said the Affordable Care Actâs exchanges will enroll 6 million people by the first deadline in March, which is 1 million fewer than earlier projections. But by the end of the decade, the number of people without insurance coverage will have dropped from 45 million today to 30 million, the agency said in its annual update on the economic and budget outlook.</p> <p>Powered by spending cuts, higher taxes and a slowly improving economy, the federal deficit will drop to less than a half-trillion dollars next year but then begin a steady climb to more than $1 trillion a year by 2022, according to CBO projections.</p> <p>Slower recovery</p> <p>The CBO said the economic recovery from the deep recession from December 2007 to June 2009 is taking longer and wonât be as strong as previous recoveries. Analysts say the labor marketâs fundamentals have shifted.</p> <p>Obamacare is one part of that because it rearranges incentives for businesses and workers.</p> <p>White House chief economic adviser Jason Furman said the health care law is about giving workers more choices. He compared it to Social Security and Medicare, which he said gave senior citizens the incentives and financial wherewithal to retire.</p> <p>In this case, he said, the CBOâs numbers show that the health care law will let younger workers make decisions about whether to remain in the workforce.</p> <p>âMaybe a spouse who wanted to be part-time so they could spend more time with their family now is able to do that,â Mr. Furman told reporters. âSomebody else who wanted to start a business and become an entrepreneur and was terrified of doing it because theyâd lose their health insurance, is now able to do that too, and switch and take a chance on creating jobs and growing the overall economy. So thereâs a lot of new choices that this will facilitate.â</p> <p>At the same time, Mr. Furman said he doesnât agree with the CBOâs numbers. He argues that agency analysts didnât take into account lower health care costs and higher worker productivity that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs a year.</p> <p>Republicans, though, used the jobs number to attack Senate Democrats seeking re-election in November.</p> <p>âThis is one of the perverse incentives in this terrible law. It actually encourages able-bodied people to not work,â said Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican. âWe should be doing all that we can to increase labor force participation. The health care law actually pushes it in the opposite direction.â</p> <p>Deficit progress</p> <p>Taking the budget as a whole, the CBO said Congress has made substantial headway on cutting spending and raising taxes, which will reduce the deficit to $514 billion this year and $478 billion in 2015.</p> <p>But it will rise by 2016 and steadily grow to more than $1 trillion in 2022.</p> <p>The CBO report said the economy isnât rebounding as fast as is typical after a recession and that poor growth means less revenue for the Treasury. That means the cumulative deficit over the next decade will be $1 trillion more than projected last year.</p> <p>National debt, which is the accumulation of annual deficits, is at its highest level since the aftermath of World War II. The CBO said debt held by the public will represent 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2024, the end of the budget window.</p> <p>The report will give ammunition to those who argued that tax increases or spending cuts should have been delayed while the government pursued more economic stimulus over the past few years.</p> <p>But the CBO suggested that the problems are more structural, given the aging U.S. population and womenâs participation in the labor force.</p> <p>The report said the labor market for the rest of this decade will recover more slowly than analysts predicted last year.</p> <p>The analysts said that at the deepest part of the recession, GDP was 7.5 percent below the economyâs potential output. By the end of 2013, just half of that gap had been closed, meaning the economy still has plenty of room to improve.</p> <p>âWith output growing so slowly, payrolls have increased slowly as well â and the slack in the labor market that can be seen in the elevated unemployment rate and part of the reduction in the rate of labor force participation mirrors the gap between actual and potential GDP,â the CBO study said.</p>",Right,Left,X,Right

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p> <p>A company behind a popular card game is trying to sabotage President Donald Trumpâs plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border by purchasing up portions of land in that long horizontal area, and offering potential customers a cut.</p> <p>Known as âa party game for horrible people,â Cards Against Humanity is asking for $15 from visitors to its site in a holiday promotion claiming that in return theyâll receive âsix surprises.â</p> <p>One of those gifts, according to the company, is a formal opportunity to buy a plot of land on or right near the border and be covered by legal representation specializing in eminent domain â rendering it not a surprise at all. The goal for the company is âto make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for the wall to get built.â</p> <p>âDonald Trump is a preposterous golem who is afraid of Mexicans,â reads the websiteâs promotion called âCards Against Humanity Saves America.â</p> <p>Ironically, despite the companyâs sympathy for immigrants and foreigners, it says in its Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section that if a would-be customer doesnât live in U.S. or Canada, they canât sign up.</p> <p>âNo. This is âCards Against Humanity Saves America,â not âCards Against Humanity Saves The Dumb Country You Live In,'â the companyâs answer reads.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the company says âAmerica will be saved,â specifically from âinjustice, lies, racism, the whole enchiladaâ if people send $15.</p> <p>The jabs at Trump and his administration are aplenty. The business admits that âweâre liars, just like the president.â Furthermore, surprises donât contain sexual content âor footage of Donald Trump watching Russian prostitutes urinate on a bed Obama slept in,â according to the company.</p> <p>When asking in the FAQ section of the website âWhy donât you just stick to card games?â and not get political, the company retorts in typical sassy fashion: âWhy donât you stick to seeing how many Hot Wheels cars you can fit up your asshole?â (RELATED: In Strange Move, DNC Knocks Trump For Lack Of Progress On Border Wall)</p> <p>All 150,000 slots to sign up for the peculiar gifts sold out within the first day.</p> <p>Cards Against Humanity did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundationâs request for further details by time of publication.</p> <p>Follow Eric on Twitter</p> <p>Send tips to [email protected].</p> <p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

b5c572aa-2a0c-4db8-a52d-a83cda5cc8d6,"The True Intent Of Indianaâs âReligious Freedomâ Bill, According To The People Who Helped Write It ",Indiana To Clarify New Law,"<p>Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) and state Republican leaders have been playing damage control this week, claiming that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is not a law that enables anti-LGBT discrimination. Meanwhile, however, the conservatives who advocated for the bill have been spurning this attempted walkback, asserting in the process that the goal was ensuring discrimination all along.</p> <p>At the forefront of the conservative reaction is Micah Clark, who serves as executive director of the American Family Association of Indiana and who stood right behind Pence as he signed the bill. Speaking Monday to Tim Wildmon, head of the national American Family Association, Clark explained that conservatives should oppose any effort to clarify that the law does not legalize discrimination. âThat could totally destroy this bill,â he explained.</p> <p>Clark has been publicly advocating for the bill as a means for allowing anti-LGBT discrimination since December, long before the legislation was even drafted. This directly contradicts the claims made Monday by House Speaker Brian Bosma (R) and Senate President Pro Tem David Long (R) that the legislation never had anything to do with discrimination.</p> <p>Eric Miller, Executive Director of Advance America, is another anti-LGBT activist who stood by Pence as he signed the bill. Advance America praised Pence for signing the bill last week, openly stating that it would allow wedding vendors to refuse to serve same-sex couples and allow Christian businesses to refuse transgender people access to restrooms. Miller was quoted as saying, âIt is vitally important to protect religious freedom in Indiana. Itâs the right thing to do. It was therefore important to pass Senate Bill 101 in 2015 in order to help protect churches, Christian businesses and individuals from those who want to punish them because of their Biblical beliefs!â Pence and Miller, it turns out, go way back.</p> <p>On the national stage, conservatives are similarly defending the RFRA and arguing it needs no fixing. Andrew Walker, Director of Policy Studies for the Southern Baptist Conventionâs Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, perhaps best summed up the distortion conservatives are using to argue that itâs not discriminatory:</p> <p>A wedding vendor who chooses not to service a same-sex wedding is not discriminating against a personâs being. Instead, the vendor believes that material cooperation in a particular event encroaches on his conscienceâ¦ To give relief to a particular wedding vendor who feels uncomfortable servicing a gay wedding isnât in any way comparable to state-sponsored discriminationâ¦ To require a wedding vendor to service a same-sex wedding is not eliminating discrimination against the gay couple. Itâs coercing the wedding vendor.</p> <p>Walker is simultaneously admitting that the law is designed to allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people while denying that itâs actually âdiscriminationâ thatâs taking place. Radio host Bryan Fischer, formerly of the American Family Association, took the Christian self-victimization a step further. âThis law is not something that provides for discrimination against gays,â he explained. âIt is something that prevents discrimination against Christiansâ¦ This thing is an anti-discrimination bill because it prohibits governmental discrimination against Christians in the state of Indiana.â</p> <p>The Heritage Instituteâs Ryan T. Anderson used this messaging to try to take on Apple CEO Tim Cook, who wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post this week calling these so-called âreligious freedomâ laws dangerous. According to Anderson, âthe only person in favor of discrimination in this debate is Tim Cook.â As one of his examples, Anderson claims, âIt is Tim Cook who would have the government discriminate against these citizens, have the government coerce them into helping to celebrate a same-sex wedding and penalize them if they try to lead their lives in accordance with their faith.â</p> <p>Using as his example Washington florist Barronelle Stutzman â who was fined last week for refusing to serve a same-sex couple â Anderson reiterates the distortion: âThis debate has nothing to do with refusing to serve gays simply because theyâre gay, and this law wouldnât protect that. But should the government force a 70-year-old grandmother to violate her beliefs? Should the government coerce her into helping to celebrate a same-sex wedding?â Anderson later highlights Aaron and Melissa Klein, bakery owners who also face fines for refusing service to a same-sex couple, as somehow another example of how RFRA is not about discrimination. He echoed these talking points on MSNBC last night as well, offering the caveat that nothing guarantees a vendor will win if they defend their discrimination with RFRA.</p> <p>The Family Research Council has been making the media rounds as well. In addition to defending Pence and the law on their website, both Tony Perkins and Peter Sprigg have taken to cable news this week to defend their positions. Sprigg went toe-to-toe with CNNâs Chris Cuomo Monday morning, where he acknowledged that wedding vendors trying to discriminate could use the law to defend themselves, but like Anderson, he tried to couch that in the idea that they wouldnât necessarily win. The only thing these Christian wedding vendors object to, Sprigg suggested, âis using their expressive abilities to communicate a message that they disagree with by saying that marriage can be a union of two men or two women,â adding that itâs âforcing them to do something that violates their faith.â</p> <p>On Fox News Monday night, Perkins continued to falsely conflate Indianaâs RFRA with laws by the same name in other states, adding, âLetâs be very clear what RFRA is. This is a shield to protect oneâs belief from government. It is not a sword to be used against anyone else and it cannot beâ¦ This is only a defense and it is not an iron-clad defense at that.â Perkins went on to describe the notion that some people want to âforce people to engage in a behavior such as weddings â photographers, florists. In a civil society, what we would say is, âOh, you donât want to service me? Fine, Iâll go next store. Iâll go down the street.ââ Borrowing a rather mockable talking point from Mike Huckabee, he added, âWho would fathom the idea of someone going into a Kosher deli and demanding a ham sandwich?â</p> <p>Despite conservatives all asserting that RFRA is designed to allow businesses to refuse to offer products and services to same-sex couples that they offer to others, Pence continued to defend the law as not being discriminatory in a Wall Street Journal op-ed posted Monday evening. Perhaps unsurprisingly, itâs The Onion that has one of the most accurate headlines this week: âIndiana Governor Insists New Law Has Nothing To Do With Thing It Explicitly Intended To Do.â</p>",Right,Left,X,Left

Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.â</p> <p>He spoke at his new Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., a visit that began with lengthy remarks from military supporters and veterans. He briefly addressed the âbirtherâ issue at the end.</p> <p>The statement comes after Trumpâs response on the matter in an interview Wednesday revived the issue. In the interview with The Washington Post, Trump was asked whether he believed Obama was born in the U.S. ""I'll answer that question at the right time,"" Trump told the paper. ""I just don't want to answer it yet.""</p> <p>Trumpâs campaign spokesman, trying to calm the waters, said overnight the Republican candidate now believes Obama was born in the U.S. Campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Trump ""did a great service to the country"" by bringing closure to the debate.</p> <p>""In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,"" Miller said.</p> <p>But the Clinton campaign seized on Trumpâs reluctance to address the issue in his Post interview.</p> <p>Speaking shortly before Trump across town at the Black Women's Agenda Symposium, Clinton said Friday the Republican nominee was âfeeding intoâ the âbigotry and bias that lurks in our countryâ â and should apologize.</p> <p>âBarack Obama was born in America,â she said. âDonald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.â</p> <p>Her campaign called his Friday comments ""disgraceful.""</p> <p>The dust-up comes as Trump gains on Clinton in national and battleground state polls, even surpassing her in some states.</p> <p>A new Fox News poll shows Clinton topping Trump by just one point among likely voters in the four-way ballot nationally.</p> <p>In the head-to-head matchup, Trumpâs up by one point.</p> <p>Both candidates were fundraising Friday after events in Washington. Clinton has endured a rough week on the campaign trail, after criticizing some Trump supporters last Friday as ""deplorables"" and then having to take time off from the campaign due to a bout of pnemonia.</p> <p>She used the birther issue to try and go back on offense.</p> <p>While Obama was born in Hawaii, Trump several years ago was a key figure in stoking the so-called ""birther"" controversy. Critics saw it as an attempt to delegitimize the nationâs first black president.</p> <p>Trump has said repeatedly during the campaign that he no longer talks about the ""birther"" issue.</p> <p>The Trump campaignâs statement late Thursday claimed that Clinton launched the âbirtherâ movement during her unsuccessful primary run against Obama in 2008.</p> <p>""Hillary Clinton's campaign first raised this issue to smear then-candidate Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President,"" the statement said. ""This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook. As usual, however, Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer.""</p> <p>Clinton has long denied the claim, and fact-checkers previously have found no public evidence that she or her campaign directly pushed the issue. Rather, Trumpâs comments appear to refer to reports that Clinton supporters circulated an email during the bitter 2008 primary race questioning Obamaâs citizenship.</p> <p>Yet former McClatchy D.C. bureau chief James Asher said on Twitter Friday that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal in fact âtold me in personâ that Obama was born in Kenya.</p> <p>Obama had released a standard short form of his birth certificate before the 2008 presidential election. Anyone who wants a copy of the more detailed, long-form document must submit a waiver request, and have that request approved by Hawaii's health department.</p> <p>In 2011, amid persistent questions from Trump about his birthplace, Obama submitted a waiver request. He dispatched his personal lawyer to Hawaii to pick up copies and carry the documents back to Washington on a plane.</p> <p>The form said Obama was born at 7:24 p.m. on Aug. 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu. It is signed by the delivery doctor, Obama's mother and the local registrar.</p> <p>At the White House on Friday, Obama declined to comment at length on the issue, saying heâs got other business to attend to â and is confident about where he was born.</p>",Left,Right,X,Right

Three other women told the newspaper Mr. Moore pursued them when they were 16 to 18 years of age.</p> <p>That was the last straw for Republicans whoâd already been at odds with Mr. Moore, their nominee, on a host of other issues.</p> <p>âThe allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying. He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of,â said Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican.</p> <p>Others didnât go that far but said if the allegations turn out to be true, Mr. Moore should step aside.</p> <p>Sen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee called the allegations âdeeply troublingâ and he and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell both said Mr. Moore should drop out if thereâs truth to the claims.</p> <p>SEE ALSO: Bannon attacks newspaper as âopposition partyâ over report on Roy Moore</p> <p>âIf thatâs true, he wouldnât belong in the Senate,â said Sen. Richard Shelby, Alabama Republican.</p> <p>Mr. Moore gave no indication he would accede to the demands and struck back at The Post on Twitter, saying they were his opponents in âa spiritual battle.â</p> <p>âThe forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal â even inflict physical harm â if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me,â Mr. Moore told supporters, urging them to stay behind him.</p> <p>âOur children and grandchildrenâs futures are on the line. So rest assured â I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!â he tweeted.</p> <p>Mr. Mooreâs campaign said if the allegations were true, they would have emerged in previous campaigns for governor or chief justice.</p> <p>Mr. Moore is running for the seat left vacant earlier this year when Jeff Sessions was tapped to be attorney general. Mr. Moore was the top vote-getter in the GOP primary and then won a runoff with Sen. Luther Strange, the man appointed to fill the seat between Mr. Sessionsâ departure and the special election slated for Dec. 12.</p> <p>The national GOP establishment â including President Trump â had fought Mr. Mooreâs nomination, backing Mr. Strange in the primary and runoff.</p> <p>But some conservative activists had rallied to the former state chief judge, arguing he was the most Trump-like candidate in the race.</p> <p>Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trumpâs former chief strategist whoâs now back at his post at Breitbart.com, was among those backing Mr. Moore. On Thursday, Breitbart called out The Post for its story, saying that the paper had endorsed Mr. Mooreâs opponent in the special election, Democratic candidate Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney.</p> <p>As chief judge, Mr. Moore gained national notoriety for defying orders that he remove a monument to the Ten Commandments from a judicial building.</p> <p>Mr. Mooreâs allies earlier this fall had said national party groups werenât doing their part to help Mr. Moore get election, even after he became the GOPâs nominee.</p> <p>That is unlikely to change now. The Senate Leadership Fund, a deep-pocketed political action committee with ties to Mr. McConnell, urged Alabama Republicans to find a way to remove Mr. Moore from the ballot.</p> <p>âThere is no place in our party for sexual predators,â said SLF President Steven Law.</p>",Left,Right,X,Right
d8cb48cf-df8b-4a63-a7fd-ccec41df0c2b,The Devastating Aftermath Of The Supreme Courtâs Immigration Decision,Court Tie Blocks Obama Immigration Plan,"<p>The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision on Thursday that will halt President Barack Obamaâs plan to defer the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants in the country â deadlocking over a controversial executive action on immigration that now leaves the fate of the undocumented population in limbo.</p> <p>The 4â4 decision will effectively leave in place a lower courtâs ruling that blocked the presidentâs 2014 initiative to expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) initiatives, which allow undocumented parents of Americans to receive temporary deportation relief and work authorization for up to three years.</p> <p>Both initiatives were blocked last February by a multi-state lawsuit. They will remain blocked as the case returns to a lower court.</p> <p>If my parents were in deportation proceedings, my family would completely break apart.</p> <p>Immigrants and advocates, many of whom stood holding signs in front of the Supreme Court on Thursday, were left feeling disappointed and angry by the decision. Major immigrant advocacy groups released statements saying they are in mourning. If the programs had been allowed to take effect, they believe it could have allowed them to be less afraid of encountering federal immigration authorities who could rip their families apart.</p> <p>For immigrants like the Pintos, a a Latino family of five with varying immigration statuses, the decision means they will continue to live in the shadows.</p> <p>âIf my parents were in deportation proceedings, my family would completely break apart,â the Pintosâ daughter Ambar, an undocumented activist who benefited from DACA, previously told ThinkProgress. âIf it was my dad, I would be the one responsible to sustain my family because my mom doesnât have access to a driverâs license and she works from time to time. I donât know what would happen to my brothers. Itâs important that we have DAPA so that my parents wonât be deported for at least two years.â</p> <p>Everything You Need To Know About The Supreme Court Challenge To Obamaâs Immigration PoliciesJustice by CREDIT: AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais Brownsville, Texas, is nowhere near the state capital in Austinâ¦thinkprogress.orgSince Thursdayâs decision sends the case back to the lower courts for further proceedings, thereâs a chance the issue could make it up to the Supreme Court again â which means that the 2016 general election may very well determine whether the policy can be resurrected. If Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wins and appoints another Supreme Court justice, like Merrick Garland, the court would have the fifth vote needed to allow the DAPA and DACA programs to take effect.</p> <p>Clinton, whose immigration policy plans include a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and a continuation of the executive actions, called the Supreme Court decision âunacceptable,â noting that the decisions âare entirely within the Presidentâs legal authority.â</p> <p>Some advocates are already setting their sights on the November election to empower Latino and minority voters to vote as a way to ensure a favorable decision.</p> <p>This betrayal is personal for us.</p> <p>âTime and time again, Latinos and immigrants have showed resilience as a community and now more than ever, it is important that we continue to show our resilience and power at the ballot box,â President and CEO Maria Teresa Kumar of the Latino voter advocacy group Voto Latino said in a press statement.</p> <p>âThis betrayal is personal for us,â Angelica Salas, executive director for the immigrant rights group Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) said. âWe will hold anti-immigrants who brought this meritless lawsuit forward accountable in November. As these politicians have tried so hard to tear our families apart, we will return strengthened, committed, organized, and ready to elect pro-immigrant leaders and the local, state, and federal levels in 2016.â</p> <p>The Supreme Court may be divided on the DAPA and DACA programs, but the American public is not. A full 73 percent of Americans, including 65 percent of Republican voters, support DAPA and expanded DACA, according to a Public Religion Research Institute poll released Thursday.</p>",Left,Right,X,Left
f4be4044-b575-4a2b-bbcc-b97450329e7c,Mistakes Were Made,IRS Apologizes,"<p>Rich â Thatâs all fair. I donât dispute that if we hadnât gone to war in 2003, or if we knew then what we know now, that Saddam might well still be in power. Itâs even the most likely scenario. We seized a moment, and as I said in that column , I think the pro-war side had the better argument at the time. But sometimes the better arguments turn out to be wrong when tested by reality. I subscribe to lots of might-have-been views on the war, and if it had been done right (assuming it could be), I wouldnât have cared one whit about the WMD stuff. But the argument for toppling Saddam â from my point of view â was never that he was the greatest threat we face, but that he was the easiest target among various great threats. Iraq, obviously, has not turned out to be so easy (as a side note, I heard Ralph Peters on C-Span this morning making a very similar case). Iâm a big supporter of the war on terror and I would like to think that even if we hadnât gone to war in 2003, I would still have favored an aggressive policy toward Iraq. That means maybe we could have waited until 2004 or used proxies or done X, Y or Z.</p> <p>Chait meanwhile was trying to play some kind of gotchya where he could claim that I was advocating the same position as him. My only point was that my view that the war was a mistake doesnât necessarily require that my preference would be an Iraq with Saddam in power today. Itâs possible, but certainly not my preferred position. Moreover, saying we should re-install Saddam simply isnât remotely the same thing as saying we shouldnât have deposed him the way we did. Just reverse it to see what I mean. If I wrote that all liberals who opposed the war really want to re-install Saddam, Iâd get spammed from angry liberals for months.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Oh, one last point: Whatever I think about how we got into Iraq, the fact is we are there and a premature bug-out (er, âredeploymentâ) would be a disaster.</p>",Right,Left,X,Right
f4ca5759-d340-4432-965f-d2a187dfc4a6,"Sanders, Warren, Mrs. Obama slam Trump and appeal for unity at unruly Dem convention","The opening was unruly, with the firing of the DNC Chairman and unruly Sanders supporters. But the evening was all about unity.","<p>Democrats tried to turn their attention Monday night from an email scandal that claimed their party chairwoman and sent Bernie Sanders supporters into near rebellion with a scorching attack on Donald Trump that ranged from unnamed references by Michelle Obama to in-your-face attacks by Elizabeth Warren and Sanders himself.</p> <p>The Vermont senator blasted Trump as a candidate who ""insults"" minorities and ""divides us up.""</p> <p>âBased on her ideas and her leadership, Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States,â the Vermont senator told the rowdy and emotional convention crowd, with many of his supporters visibly crying during his remarks and chanting his name.</p> <p>Sanders appealed to supporters Monday night to get behind Clinton, as he tried to restore order at the Democratic convention after a chaotic opening day marked by intense street protests and near-constant disruptions inside the arena from delegates and others loyal to him.</p> <p>Sanders suddenly found himself in the role of helping the Democratic Party whose establishment had shunned him for much of the primary race. But he now is virtually their only hope for easing the tensions at the Philadelphia convention, where delegates are poised to crown Clinton as the partyâs presidential nominee on Tuesday.</p> <p>âI understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process. I think itâs fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am,â he told delegates. âBut to all of our supporters â here and around the country â I hope you take enormous pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved.â</p> <p>Sanders argued that, despite his differences with Clinton during the primary campaign, her views are far more in line with his than are Republican nominee Trumpâs â on issues ranging from the minimum wage to climate change to college tuition costs.</p> <p>âIt is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues,â he said. But Sanders said they have come together on some of them, and his side was able to win major changes to the party platform.</p> <p>âHillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her tonight,â Sanders said, though some in the audience still booed at Clintonâs name.</p> <p>Trump, tweeting from the sidelines, fired back:</p> <p>Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2016</p> <p>Sanders was joined by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in appealing to the left wing of the party to unite behind Clinton. First lady Michelle Obama, too, worked to ease the tensions in the convention hall in an earlier speech that at times seemed to rally the divided crowd.</p> <p>âAmerica faces a choice,â Warren said. âWeâre here today because our choice is Hillary Clinton. Iâm with Hillary.â</p> <p>She called Trump a ""man who inherited a fortune from his fatherâ and cares only for himself.</p> <p>""Donald Trump has no real plans for jobs, for college kids, for seniors. No plans to make anything great for anyone except rich guys like Donald Trump.""</p> <p>The liberal icon, who spoke right before Sanders, still faced small pockets of unrest as she delivered a full-throated Clinton endorsement, with some people chanting âwe trusted youâ over her remarks. But Warren called Clinton âa woman who fights for all of us.â</p> <p>Together, the two speakers had an opportunity to tamp down the unrest among liberal activists, many of whom not only backed Sanders during the turbulent primary battle but wanted to either see Warren step into the ring or be tapped for running mate. Whether their words can now help calm the storm inside and outside the convention hall remains to be seen.</p> <p>Sandersâ speech could help. âIt was a very unifying message, the essence of unity,â Kit Andrews, a Vermont alternate delegate and Sanders supporter, told FoxNews.com. âItâs a long process to bring people together. He has always said that.â</p> <p>Sanders and Warren, along with Michelle Obama and Clinton booster New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, addressed the convention at the close of a noisy and boisterous Monday session. From the very start, Sanders supporters booed and jeered convention officials as they tried to gavel in.</p> <p>Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, who was presiding, scolded the protesters as they interrupted at the very mention of Clinton.</p> <p>âWe are all Democrats, and we need to act like it,â she said.</p> <p>Michelle Obama, speaking hours and countless disruptions later, seemed to draw a more positive response, eliciting applause during her lines on Clinton.</p> <p>âIâm with her,â Obama declared, asking Democrats to do for the former secretary of state what they did for her husband â and turn out to the polls.</p> <p>âBetween now and November, we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago. â¦ We need to get out every vote!â she said. âLetâs get to work.â</p> <p>The audience remained visibly divided during her remarks, however, with one man being shushed for saying, âWe love you, Michelle.â</p> <p>Obama didn't leave the stage without taking a veiled shot at Trump. She warned that the White House couldn't be in the hands of someone with a ""thin skin or tendency to lash out or someone who tells voters the country could be great again.</p> <p>Booker, who had been considered for running mate before the job went to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, earlier blasted Republican nominee Donald Trump while touting Clintonâs support for a âfair wageâ and âdebt-free collegeâ â and trying to connect her ideals to Sandersâ.</p> <p>âIt represents the best of our values, the best of our history and the best of our party -- all of our shared ideas and values together,â Booker said.</p> <p>Several celebrities including comedian Sarah Silverman and actress Eva Longoria also rallied to Clintonâs defense â with Silverman even taking on the Sanders crowd, saying, âBernie or bust people, youâre being ridiculous.â</p> <p>Even before the disruptions in the arena, the convention had kicked off Monday under a cloud of controversy -- after the leak of emails indicating an anti-Bernie Sanders bias inside the DNC forced the resignation of Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p> <p>She had been expected to open the convention anyway, but after facing continued backlash from Sanders supporters Monday morning was replaced in that role by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.</p> <p>Anti-Clinton sentiment, however, continued to run high inside and outside the convention site, as pro-Sanders and other demonstrators marched from Camden to downtown Philadelphia and ultimately toward the arena â all while the convention was gaveling in. Inside the hall, Sanders supporters jeered Democratic officials trying to move the proceedings along.</p> <p>The developments added up to a far more chaotic start than at the Republicansâ convention a week ago in Cleveland. Trump, from the sidelines, stoked the unrest inside the Democratic ranks by tweeting about how Bernie Sanders had been mistreated by the party.</p> <p>He tweeted before the convention start: âThe Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!â</p> <p>FoxNews.comâs Joseph Weber, Fox Newsâ Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>",Left,Right,X,Right
